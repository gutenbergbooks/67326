persons ate twice as much as was good for
them; and some, who were extravagantly gluttonous,
ate ten times as much as was their most
economic need; and Cornaro, who was a dissipated
wreck at forty, reformed his manner of
eating and lived to be a hundred to prove his
declaration.</p>

<p>Experiments carried on in this country and
in Europe during the past five years confirm
this estimate of habitual excess; but fortunately
they have also revealed a natural protection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
heretofore unappreciated, available to all, which
can regulate the appetite to suit the real needs
of nutrition and thus avoid the dangerous excess
which predisposes to discomfort and disease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Luigi Cornaro lived more than three hundred
years ago. His charmingly frank and interesting
autobiography has been published in English
upwards of forty times in different new
editions, and no one has disproved the possibility
or probability of his claim. We all know
that Cornaro was right. We know, in a general
way, that the great Italian dietitian and philosopher
was wise and uttered wisdom, and we
are told that most, if not all, of the diseases
which pain, worry, and afflict us are caused
by indigestion or mal-assimilation of food, the
result of some indiscretions of eating. The questions
then are “What are our indiscretions?”
“How can we avoid them?” and “What is the
new discovery that will protect us and, at the
same time, add to the pleasures of the palate
and of living?”</p>

<p>The answers to all these queries will be
found herein, as will also an explanation of the
very active interest which is being taken just
now in the problem of human nutrition by
scientific and military authorities, as evidenced
by the Yale investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span></p>

<p>The author has, in collaboration with several
others, found a way how <i>not to eat too much</i>
while eating <i>all that the appetite desires</i>, and in
a way that leads to a <i>maximum of good taste</i>
and at a <i>minimum of cost and waste</i>, but it is
necessary to test many persons of different physiques
and varying temperaments, and also to
test other methods of attainment of economy,
to learn what is best for general application,
and that is what is being done at Yale.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The cost to the pocket that is saved by
economic nutrition is of little matter as compared
with the saving of the waste of energy
and the menace of disease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nature certainly never intended that we
should weaken, depress, and distress ourselves
in the way that is common to present-day living,
as is made evident by the prevalence of discomfort
and disease relative to our daily food.
Nature’s plan of evolution does not work that
way in general, does not retrograde in the
progress of the improvement of plants and
dumb animals, and certainly does not intend
that Man, the First Assistant of Nature in the
cultivation of things and in the domestication
of the powerful natural forces, should suffer and
become degenerate contrary to her general law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>If we are agreed upon the foregoing, let us
ask ourselves a few questions.</p>

<p>Without any undue egotism, may it not
be possible for a generation of human beings,
who have progressed so far in intelligence as
to be able to move things by steam, to communicate
across the ocean even without wires to
guide our messages, and to see clearly through
objects that are as dark as night to the unassisted
human eye with the aid of an artificial
light, to learn the secret of right self-nutrition
and practise it in a manner that will not deprive
us of the maximum of pleasure which Nature
invariably gives as a reward for conformity with
her beneficent requirements? May we not assume
that beings who have learned to breed and
train horses to race with human intelligence,
and to run, trot, or pace a mile in less than
two minutes, may also train themselves to have
the proportional relative speed, endurance,
and longevity that has been attained by race
horses through man’s care, and to enjoy the
pleasure of living that is evident in these favoured
animals, mere servitors of man though
they be?</p>

<p>If this disparity of man is due to ignorance
arising in self-neglect, which is the usual accompaniment
of genius, may we not now, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
beginning of the pregnant twentieth century,
rest for a moment from discovering, developing,
and improving the world outside our personal
selves and concentrate our attention for a while
on learning to know and care for ourselves?
May we not, at least, give “horse sense” attention
to such a vital interest?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the midst of the present confusion which
exists among opinions as to the right conduct
of life and activity, and the best manner and
system of diet to be used to secure health
and efficiency, it seems almost a vain appeal to
call for concert of action in a matter of common
and persistent neglect. Each person, as
his own keeper, is careless, and in matters of
bodily management no one feels called upon
to be his brother’s keeper; but this is merely
the lethargy of oversight and consequent ignorance,
and this book is published to call attention
to the oversight and to attempt to dispel
the ignorance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the present moment of writing (October,
1903) there are quartered at New Haven, Connecticut,
twenty privates of the Hospital Corps
of the United States Army and three non-commissioned
officers, under the command of Assistant
Surgeon, Lieutenant Wallace DeWitt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
These men and officers, while they are under
regular army discipline and are performing duty
in conformity with their oath of enlistment, are
yet volunteers. They are from the same corps,
if they are not the same men, which furnished
volunteers to investigate the causes of yellow
fever in Cuba, whose heroism resulted in stamping
the fever out of the islands and in that more
effectually protecting our coast states from its
yearly incursions. These are the same men
who generously refused to accept the offered
bounty. This latter expression of exalted manhood
is evidence of what humanity is whenever
there is real need for heroes to serve the general
good. They refused to <i>sell</i> themselves as
risks for money, but they freely <i>offered</i> themselves
as subjects of scientific investigation for
the benefit of their fellows and of mankind at
large.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The duty that the soldiers are engaged in at
Yale has no element of risk, and need not have
any feature of monotony or tediousness in it,
much less has it the romance of sacrifice, for it
deals with an attempt to restore normality and
does not consort with disease. But the service
being rendered by these guardians of our health,
these soldiers of hygiene, is even more important
than was the service rendered in stamping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
out yellow fever, for it deals with an enemy much
more subtle, treacherous, common, and deadly
than Yellow Jack. Yellow fever calls for a halt
and an immediate attempt at cure, and further,
for stringent defence to extermination; but indigestion
and the American plague, <i>dyspepsia</i>,
work their evils slowly but surely to cut off our
best men and loveliest women in their prime and
to rob us of their richest product and of their
maturest wisdom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The investigation at Yale is a link in a chain
of effort that has developed in logical sequence
and has been planned to effect a cure of the
common ignorance and practice relative to right
human nutrition in its relation to profitable
thinking and doing; and to discourage the personal
neglect which has been responsible for
the existing ignorance, this book is issued to
show what may easily be done and what has
been done, so far, in this direction. It is a
compilation of important knowledge which has
been born of recent scientific research but which
is hidden away from common comprehension in
scientific publications; and it relates the story
of the development of which this book is an
exponent. Herein are given the reasons why
the government and the most eminent scientists
in the line of researches in nutrition are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
coöperating so earnestly and so unusually in a
commonweal inquiry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About ten years ago, at the critical age of
forty-four, the author was fast becoming a physical
wreck in the midst of a business, club, and
social tempest. Although he was trained as an
athlete in his youth and had lived an active and
most agreeable life, he had contracted a degree
of physical disorder that made him ineligible as
an insurance risk. This unexpected disability,
with such unmistakable warning, was so much a
shock to his hopes of a long life that it led to
his making a strong personal effort to save himself.
The study was taken up in systematic
manner, account of which is too long to relate
here; but the eager auto-reformer soon learned
that his troubles came from <i>too much</i> of many
things, among them too much food and too
much needless worry; and realising the danger
ahead, he sought a way to cure himself of his
disabilities by the help of an economic food
supply, as did Luigi Cornaro; but what is even
more important, he found a way to enjoy the
smaller quantity of food much more than any
plethoric luxury can give, and arrived at the
method by a route that showed a means of
conserving a healthy economy and an increased
pleasure of eating, at the same time, in quite a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
simple and scientific manner, that any one may
learn and practise without any ascetic deprivation
whatever. Cornaro buried the real clew to
his economic and pleasurable success with his
body, owing to his vague generality of description
of his method. The author is determined
not to make the same mistake, and thereby bury
<i>his</i> key to a happy and easy life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The secret of the method is all told in this
book and is confirmed herein by both theoretically
scientific and scientifically practical authority;
but the experiments which are being
conducted at Yale by Professor Chittenden, in
coöperation with Surgeon-General O’Reilly of
the army, of which the <i>Daily Press</i> has given
notice, together with experiments which are in
progress in many university laboratories in this
country and in Europe, are for the purpose of
explaining the “reasons for things” by complete
scientific reasoning, so that none may
doubt the disadvantage and sin of dietic ignorance
and carelessness.</p>

<p>The acceptance of the theory and method of
the author at the great Battle Creek Sanitarium,
after more than a year’s trial, and elsewhere
among curative agencies, and their adoption
and use as the first requisite of treatment, of
which the public have not so generally heard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
are indorsements coming from practical, intelligent,
and expert sources of experience and
judgment, and hence they are of the utmost
value and significance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This introductory chapter is being written
after the “clippings” of newspaper comment
relative to the presence of the soldiers at Yale
have begun to come in. The majority of comments
are generous in spirit, but indicate a lack
of complete understanding which this “Introduction”
is intended to correct.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some of the comments are couched in ridicule,
and express pity for the poor soldiers who
are being “misused” as subjects of starvation
in an investigation which promises to make
starvation a rule in the army. To the writers
of such trifling and unfair paragraphs let me,
one of the fraternity in an amateurish way, beg
consideration of the following.</p>

<p>The campaign that has been started is against
a common enemy of mankind, and of the American
and English nations in particular. In our
successes in agriculture, manufacture, and commerce
we have cultivated insidious, luxurious
temptations which bring all of us some ill and
many of us, or our loved ones, fatal disease
and premature death. The advance agent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
these enemies of ours is Eating-and-drinking-too-much.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The officers and men of the army and the
eminent scientists of our country and those of
all nationalities who have entered into the campaign
with us, and the great power of the sanitaria
joining as practical nurses, demonstrators,
and exponents of the reform, are all working
for you and for everybody. It is voluntary
service and has already cost some of the volunteers
much time and patience and also a considerable
sum in money.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You, gentlemen of the Press, wielders of
the helpful or careless pen, have a conspicuous
pulpit and a far-reaching influence. No
one can escape you. In the search for the
news of the day you are encountered at every
turn in your editorials or your paragraphs. In
this campaign we need your assistance to make
the coöperation between the army and science
easy and effective. They are too busy working
for you and your best interest to stop to
argue to correct your misunderstanding, but
the cause will feel the benefit of your assistance.</p>

<p>Encouragement has powerful influence in
stimulating effort and also in creating and conserving
conditions in which men may “do their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
best.” What we are trying to learn is, what
man <i>may</i> do, under favourable conditions of
knowledge and confidence, to relieve his body
of the <i>strain of energy-taxing labour</i> in disposing
of the waste <i>which any excess of food
imposes</i>. It is a constructive experiment and
not a mere statistical measurement. Appreciation
and applause assist; doubt and ridicule
obstruct.</p>

<p>The soldiers and physiologists are too busy
studying indigestion and possible proteid poisoning
and what-not-other causes of intemperance,
disease, and suffering to ask you to assist in
spreading only serious report and right suggestion
relative to the importance and purport
of the investigation, but it is my privilege to
ask it for the general good.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just another word of introduction and then
will follow some <i>postintroductory</i> coincidences
relative to the work in hand, and then an
attempt to lay out a ten-page chart of the
personal responsibility in the care of the body
and the nourishment of the mind by aid of an
economic and most satisfactory nutrition, so as
to make conservation of energy as easy as possible
and life well worth the living. The scientific
support from the pens of professional
observers is, however, the real meat of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
book, for which compiler and reader alike are
and should be grateful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In serving in the humanitarian ranks in a
commonweal campaign one should not need to
use the concealment of modesty, nor should he
fail to speak with all frankness. What are the
motives behind all this energy to reform the
eating habits of the people? The question has
been so often asked that it is better thus publicly
answered.</p>

<p>No one concerned in the campaign has any
personal monetary interest in any kind of food,
prepared or otherwise. The movement began
in a suggestion carried by an accidental word
given to the author by a friend, an old-time
friend in Japan, and a friendship never to be forgotten,
as related in the author’s book “Menticulture.”
Pursuit of menticulture led further to
the discovery that the best mental results could
not be accomplished in a body weakened by
any indigestion, any mal-assimilation of nutriment,
any excess of the waste of indigestion.
Then came the quest for the causes of mal-nutrition,
which were soon found, by study of
the natural sequences and by going behind the
hypotheses of text-book authority, to arise in
the careless ingestion of food, its neglect in
the mouth, and the consequent glut of unas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>similable
excess within the body, necessitating
enormous expense of brain and body energy
to get rid of the excess.</p>

<p>When the secret of the potency for good of a
rationally economic alimentation was revealed to
the author, was confirmed by several colleagues
of different ages and both sexes, and was tested
by work and endurance measurement, and also
by the test time, it became necessary to have
given to it the indorsement of highest authority
in order to have the information credited. The
new rediscovery was a simple matter, something
everybody thought they knew all about because
it had been under their nose all their life and
was one of the commonplaces of every-day living,
but for that very reason it failed to receive
credence, and the backbone of the doubt was
habit&mdash;lifelong habit&mdash;and this was hard to
break even in those who accepted the theory
of economic nutrition as a logical conviction.
It was also necessary to prove that it was not
personal idiosyncrasy that favoured us, its
advocates.</p>

<p>It is in pursuit of the latter desideratum that
the officers of the army, the scientists, and the
great humanitarian health-restoring institutions
have entered upon conclusive investigations,
each in their own way, to chart out a law of
economy that will be generally applicable and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span>
which, it is hoped, can be understood by kindergartners
and mothers for the benefit of the
present and of coming generations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was just stated that no one concerned
in the inquiry was interested in any food
product or in any personally profitable business
concern, and mention of the Battle Creek
Sanitarium, so widely known as the pioneer
in fostering the pure food and prepared-cereal
manufacture, may cast a doubt upon the matter
in the minds of those who do not know that
the Sanitarium organisation, in its every department,
is a philanthropic, humanitarian
institution. It is the parent and feeder of the
American Medical Missionary Cause, which
already has established branches in something
over sixty localities situated in or near large
cities in different parts of the world, chiefly
America. By perpetual charter all the profits
revert to the spread of the work and the employees
serve for a mere pittance, deriving
their major compensation from enjoyment of
the altruistic work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The old prejudice against the human race
which declared that “everybody had an axe to
grind,” that there was “a nigger in every woodpile,”
and such like slanders, must be modified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</span>
in the light of recent altruistic development.
Altruism has always been existent and had a
great new birth with the beginning of our era,
but it was never before so frankly put upon a
business basis as it is now, and this is fast being
applied to every department of business activity.
It is now done, not in the name of any
particular creed or cult, or for future reward,
but because <i>it pays</i>&mdash;first, last, and all the time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the study and pursuit of menticulture the
author has found that working for the common
good is as necessary to happiness as working for
self, and that the retroactivity and reciprocity of
the idea multiplies the profits indefinitely.</p>

<p>The sequence of profitable, altruistic interrelation
is stated in the “Explanation” of the
chain of the A. B. C. Life Series, of which this
book is one of the links.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Aside from those actively engaged in the
several investigations to whom reference is often
made, the author wishes to express special gratitude
to Sir Michael Foster and to Professor
Henry Pickering Bowditch of the Board of Scientific
Assessors. Unselfish and unremitting in
their assistance and encouragement, the author’s
work has been made easy since their interest
was enlisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</span></p>

<p>Sir Michael, as Member of Parliament in
England, and as a physiological savant, knows
that economic nutrition is the key to England’s
welfare, as well as the basic necessity of temperance,
morality, health, and efficiency, as is
expressed in the two documents from him
reproduced in the “Report of a Plan for an
International Investigation into the Subject of
Human Nutrition” and in his “Note” on the
Cambridge examination of the author and Dr.
Van Someren at Cambridge University laboratories,
given herein.</p>

<p>Professor Bowditch, as a distinguished physiologist,
publicist, and especially as the President
of the Children’s Aid Society, of Boston,
Massachusetts, often mentioned as the model
institution of its kind in the world, realises that
the effort of the author to secure basic knowledge
relative to right nutrition, adaptable to
kindergarten teaching and home training during
the impressionable period of youth, is of
the greatest importance in social reform.</p>

<p>A trial suggestion relative to ways and means
of <i>beginning right</i> with <i>all the children</i> and thus
insuring a regeneration of the classes most in
need of reform, in not longer than two decades,
is outlined in the author’s appeal for the waifs
of society, entitled “That Last Waif; or Social
Quarantine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</span></p>

<p>Whenever there is any disposition to slack
up in patience or enthusiasm to accomplish the
ultimate end aimed at, the picture of the waif in
that story is flashed back by memory, and there
can be neither forgetfulness, indifference, nor
repose until “that last waif” has been given <i>at
least a chance of choosing</i> between the right and
the wrong, the good and the bad.</p>

<p>[Just before “going to press” the author has
received a letter from his esteemed colleague,
Dr. Hubert Higgins, giving the gist of interviews
with an eminent European physiologist
and with a famous American chemist and dietitian,
which so well describes the attitude of the
scientific mind towards the problem of human
nutrition that the scientific mentor of the writer
advises its addition to the book.</p>

<p>By the same post there arrived a letter from
Dr. J. H. Kellogg, the life and director of the
Battle Creek Sanitarium, expressing practical
appreciation, the result of demonstration, of
what is being done to solve the problem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Fletcher</span>,&mdash;A. appears to me
to have an exceedingly broad and philosophic
grasp of the problem of nutrition.</p>

<p>He recognises that all present data are subject
to criticism, and that there are no scientifically
accurate data available because</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Observations are taken over too short a
period.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) They have mainly dealt with one side
of the problem,&mdash;the output of
muscular work.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The observations are not sufficiently
complete.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</span></p>

<p>He acknowledges that cleavage products
from food broken down in the intestines by
bacteria are the cause of</p>

<ul>
<li>
(<i>a</i>) Inefficiency</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Diseases</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Mental derangements.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 4em;">(See Mott’s work.)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>He recognises that the majority of people
eat far too much. He puts this in the following
way. If a “mediæval devil” had wished to
discover the most subtle and most effective way
to destroy mankind mentally, morally, and
physically, he would have arranged for them
to be supplied with tasty, well-cooked foods,
wines, etc.; in short, he would have used every
means to tempt, confuse, and pervert their appetite.
He would also have arranged every
possible means to prevent their being in the
fresh air and taking exercise. He thinks one
has here the picture of modern civilisation.</p>

<p>He talked in a very interesting and instructive
manner about the necessity and value of
exercise and a muscular body for the maintenance
of good health. He has evidently worked
at and thought a good deal about this side of
the subject.</p>

<p>He regrets that there are not more people
who realise the huge importance of under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</span>standing
the nutrition problem for the sake
of the progress of humanity. He would like
to join all those who are interested in forming
an international society, as far as I understood
him.</p>

<p>He is most keen on getting subjects, such
as myself, for study over a very long period of
time,&mdash;two to three years,&mdash;as he very justly
observed “Muscular output is a very small
part of the measure of a man’s efficiency.
Mental efficiency, manual dexterity, and other
psychological tests are necessary.” He seemed
very much interested in my idea of making a
large number of curves of daily observations.
He said that it appeared to him to offer the
best means of ultimately measuring the degree
of deviation from the subject’s optimum state
of health.</p>

<p>He argues the necessity of getting some
scientific definition of health.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The phrase that reduces all these people to
contemplative silence is this.</p>

<p>“You acknowledge that the state of knowledge
is insufficient to prescribe a diet for any
individual that he should take daily; or in
other words, that there is very little accurate
knowledge of the nutrition problem.”</p>

<p>Reply. “Yes. I do not feel I could pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</span>scribe
a diet for any one with any degree of
confidence.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Why should not the
body have or acquire the quality that all animals
have, in a free, natural state, of knowing
what their body wants by appetite and taste?”</p>

<p>This is more or less how you put it to me
when I first met you at Cambridge. Its full
significance did not dawn on me till much later;
till, in short, I commenced the study of my
desires at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Now this point of view is the rock on which
we stand, and is the cause of H.’s and A.’s interest,
and as H. said, is the “most fascinating
idea” he ever heard.</p>

<p>It had very much the same effect on A. He
was reduced to silence. The more you think
of it the more you see there is no answer that
could contradict it.</p>

<p><i>He then admits that</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The food should be finely divided.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That it should be thoroughly insalivated.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That in all probability most diseases are
caused by dietetic error.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) That we have still to find the optimum
health and the optimum diet.</p>

<p>He only kicks at the low proteid. Now I
don’t care a “kuss” for the low proteid, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</span>
such, or high proteid. Proteid like everything
else will be demanded by the appetite when it
is wanted.</p>

<p>Our great danger, to my mind, is the tendency
so strongly exemplified by some of prescribing
diets and quantities and the length
of time food should be chewed.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now the very
errors we are fighting against are the prescription
of methods on insufficient information or
knowledge. <i>You have gone straight back to
Nature.</i> <i>There is your strength</i> in convincing
the scientific world, and we must study the
problem from that point of view if we are to get
any great degree of success.</p>

<p>A. had nothing to say when I told him that
I did not hold by either high or low proteid but
only by my appetite and taste, developed by
ample mouth opportunity to discriminate, which
I hoped, in time, to understand more thoroughly
than I do now. He told me that he
feared that there would be great physical deterioration
after a long period of low proteid.
I said that I did not believe it would be the
case by your method. For instance, right in
the midst of a long period of most satisfactory
low-proteid supply, I once ate nearly a whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</span>
chicken with some ham at Penegal. I could not
get saliva for anything else.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In short, then, I
insisted only on thorough mastication to protect
taste and appetite, and had no other theories.
I was only concerned in observing the factors
determining my taste and appetite. I would be
more than contented to leave the question of
minimum and maximum quantity of proteid to
be settled in the future after normality had been
established by practical demonstration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Yours of September 30th
just reached my hands and I hasten to reply.</p>

<p>I saw a newspaper note in reference to the
soldiers which the government has selected for
the dietetic experiments, and also read an interesting
article in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>.
You have accomplished a great good thing in
enlisting these scientific and military men and
interesting them in the investigation of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</span>
wonderful reform. The marvellous thing about
it is that these busy men of science should have
so readily undertaken an investigation which
involves so much surrender and self-denial, at
least, at the start. I know you are absolutely
right. My personal experiences and observations
confirm me. In the experiments you
mention, which I made in reference to the daily
ration for ordinary persons, I simply sought to
ascertain, as have others, how much and what
kinds of food people are in the habit of using,
taking no account of the possible excess or the
careless manner in which they eat. The figures
I got were sixteen ounces of starch; 1.2 ounces
fat, and three ounces proteids,&mdash;approximately
2,500 calories. In observation of patients I have
seldom found one able to eat this amount.
Personally, I habitually eat scarcely half as
much. My breakfast to-day was the yolks of
two eggs, two or three tablespoonfuls of corn
flakes, a moderate-sized potato, and a couple of
peaches. At dinner I shall take a little more.</p>

<p>I have been so busy with my patients and
the new building, getting things organised, that
I have not done as much as I ought to in the
way of promoting your splendid reform; but I
am going at it now in good earnest. I feel it is
one of the greatest things in sight, and it fits
right in to all the other things I am trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</span>
do. I feel that I owe you continually a great
debt for the efforts you have made and the
splendid work you are doing, which will accomplish
more for the uplifting of humanity than
all that Carnegie and Rockefeller are doing with
their millions. What they are doing is mainly
to perpetuate old errors, while you are bringing
out new truth of basic importance, and a kind
Providence has certainly inspired you to do this
grand work.</p>

<p>I thank you for all your good thoughts
towards us, and assure you the loving encouragement
your letters always contain is very
much appreciated, and sometimes it gives us a
mental uplift just when we need it. The road
we are travelling over is not altogether free from
thorns. All your suggestions are gratefully
received. I remain,</p>

</div>


<p>This is a condensed presentment of a subject
of basic importance to everyone,
supported by numerous appendices of great
scientific weight.</p>

<p>The special object of such brevity and elementary
treatment of the subject is:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> To accentuate the facts showing how little
we really have to know and do in connection
with our sustenance in order to have the
<span class="smcap">Natural Automatic Processes</span> done rightly
and healthfully.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> To permit busy persons who will take our
dictum as gospel and our advice as sound
to learn their necessary share in their own nutrition
in the least possible time, leaving the less
credulous and more curious to study the appendices
at leisure and at will.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> For some ten years it has been the ambition
and the aim of the older and non-professional
author to embody the fundamental essentials of
human responsibility in self-understanding and
self-management in not more than ten pages of
coarse print that a child could understand and
that mothers and teachers might commit to
memory and never forget.</p>

<p>This is only a first trial-attempt to fulfil the
ambition and the aim; but the appendices show
the assembling and concentration of scientific
and militant forces which will not allow this subject
of primal human interest to remain longer
the most neglected of educational departments.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SOME_PERTINENT">SOME PERTINENT
QUESTIONS</h3>
</div>


<p>Will the reader not ask himself the following
questions?</p>

<p><b>1.</b> How much do I know about my own nutrition?</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Do I know the particular need and purpose
of my last meal and what it is likely to
accomplish?</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Considering my body as an engine, would
I accept myself as a competent engineer on
my own examination and confession?</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Were I an iron and steel automobile, instead
of a flesh and blood automobile, which I
really am, could I get a license for myself, as a
<i>chauffeur</i>, to run myself with safety, based upon
my knowledge of my own mechanism and the
theory and development of my power?</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Were I an owner of valuable live-stock,
would I employ a farm-hand or a stable
man, even at so low a wage as fifteen dollars a
month, who knew as little about the proper
feeding of my animals as I know about the
proper feeding of myself and my children?</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Should I employ such an ignorant attendant
for my live-stock, and catch him worrying
them during their feeding, and hurrying them
away from their fodder to hitch them up for work,
would I not have the man arrested for cruelty
to animals? And yet this is what is habitually
done to children!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p><b>7.</b> Do I appreciate how important it is to learn
sufficient of the requirements of economic
and healthy nutrition to enable me to escape
the depressing and debilitating effects of a
faulty nutrition.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> How can I religiously “ask a blessing”
upon food and then immediately sin by
treating it in a manner abhorrent to the natural
requirements?</p>

<p><b>9.</b> If “cleanliness is next to godliness” is it
respectable for me to slight my proper
feeding in a manner that I know may induce
putridity of excreta through indigestion and
that <i>may</i> produce fatal disease?</p>

<p><b>10.</b> With All Eternity ahead of me, cannot I
afford at least 1/48<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of my time for careful
feeding of my body in a manner known to
favour physical health; mental keenness; firmness
of character; enjoyable temperance; sexual
vigour without morbidity. In fact, general
respectability and efficiency?</p>

<p>Having duly reasoned out logical answers to
the questions, may they not seem sufficiently
important to be remembered and respected as
a <span class="smcap">Dietary Ten Commandments</span>?</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Appetite</span> is the most important factor in
digestion (vide Pawlow).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Normal Appetite</span> is indicated by a desire
for <i>some particular</i> simple food accompanied
by a “watering of the mouth.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Appetite</span> is a general discontent of
the body, indefinite of description. It is often
expressed by “all gone-ness,” or stomach craving,
and calls for <i>something</i>, <span class="smcap">Anything!</span> to
smother the discomfort of present or recent indigestion.
It is like the thirst which follows a
debauch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignore False Appetite</span>, and <span class="smcap">Wait</span> for
a <span class="smcap">Return</span> of <span class="smcap">Normal Appetite</span>. It will come
as soon as body repairs have been effected by
natural agencies and more material is required.
No one was ever injured by intelligently and
calmly waiting for an appetite. No one ever
starved to death for lack of appetite. Most
human ills come from forcing appetite, anticipating
appetite, abuse of appetite in some form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appetite</span> is the most important factor in
nutrition. This estimation is based upon evidence
given more fully in the various appendices,
but the measure of its importance may be
briefly stated, as follows:—</p>


<p><i>First</i></p>

<p>In its normal state, Appetite is a perfect
indicator of the bodily need of
nutriment and moisture, both as to quantity and
as to the chemical elements required at the
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>


<p><i>Second</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appetite</span> is a creature of the mind
and does not attach to a tissue. It
can be as easily changed, from abnormal to
normal, by suggestion, as can the mind itself,
and is not like a solid, the form or habit of
which has been set in a mould. Whoever has
once experienced a bad oyster and has abhorred
oysters ever after will substantiate this claim
regarding the caprices of appetite.</p>


<p><i>Third</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appetite</span> can be easily comprehended
and read and the degrees of its satisfaction
understood by simple attention and
study for a brief period (vide Van Someren).</p>


<p><i>Fourth</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attention</span> is necessary to create
<span class="smcap">Appreciation</span>, and appreciation is
absolutely necessary to stimulate the secretion
and flow of gastric and other digestive juices
(vide Pawlow).</p>


<p><i>Fifth</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anger</span>, or shock of any kind, and
<span class="smcap">Worry</span>, or any of the pessimistic depressants,
stop digestive activity and cause indigestion
(vide Cannon).</p>


<p><i>Sixth</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menticulture</span> should begin with its
application to selection (through a
normalised appetite) of nutriment for the body,
and continue to aid digestion by right thinking.</p>

<p>It is very easy to cultivate calm and fortify
against surprise, shock, and anger if the nutrition
of the body is carefully attended to. The
physical and the mental equipments are beautifully
reciprocal and necessary to each other in
promoting <span class="smcap">Menticulture</span>.</p>

<big>MOUTH THOROUGHNESS</big></p>


<p>Mouth treatment of food, which permits, aids,
and includes insalivation (mixing with saliva),
and which is both actively digestive in its functions
and preparatory to final digestion, is the
only <i>actual mechanical responsibility</i> we have in
our nutrition; and, in connection with favourable
A conditions, insures perfect digestion. It
has been so fully and clearly explained in some
recent articles, “Observations on Mastication,”
by Dr. Harry Campbell, F.R.C.P., physician to
the Northwest London Hospital, printed in the
“Lancet” of July 11th, 18th, 25th, and August
8th, 1903, that reference to the articles, reprinted
herewith, is all that is necessary here.</p>

<p>In giving attention to careful mouth-treatment
of soft or liquid foods until they are absorbed
by the Swallowing Impulse the best health and
economic results are obtained. It should, at
least, be tried.</p>

<p>This will not be found to be a tedious operation
after a little practice, when the habit of
attention and care has been formed. On the
contrary, a new appreciation and enjoyment of
taste will be acquired, the delight of which has
to be experienced to be understood.</p>

<p>Some hints on learning how to <i>read</i> the appetite,
<i>command</i> the attention, and <i>masticate</i> and
<i>swallow</i> food material <i>properly</i> follow.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="METHOD">METHOD</h4>
</div>


<p><i>First; Last;
and
All the Time</i></p>

<p>Be sure that you are really
hungry and are not pampering
False Appetite.
If true appetite that will
relish plain bread alone is not present, wait for
it. Especially beware of the early-morning
habit-craving. Wait for an <i>earned</i> appetite, if
you have to wait till noon. Then: “Chew,”
“Masticate,” “Munch,” “Bite,” “Taste” everything
you take in your mouth (except water,
<i>which has no taste</i>), until it is not only thoroughly
liquefied and made neutral or alkaline
by saliva, but until the reduced substance all
settles back in the (glosso-epiglottidean) folds
at the back of the mouth and excites the
Swallowing Impulse into a strong inclination
to swallow. Then swallow what has collected
and has excited the impulse, and continue to
chew <i>at</i> the remainder, liquid though it be,
until the last morsel disappears in response to
the Swallowing Impulse. Never forcibly swallow
anything that the instincts connected with
the mouth show any disposition to reject. It
is safer to get rid of it beforehand than to risk
putting it into the stomach.</p>

<p>Sip and taste milk and all liquids that have
taste as the wine-tasters do. They never drink
wine and yet they get all the enjoyment there
is in it and waste none. In a very short time
sipping and tasting liquids and masticating and
tasting solid food for “all they are worth” will
become an agreeable and profitable fixed habit.</p>

<p class="center"><big>THE DIGESTION-ASH WHAT IT<br />
SHOULD BE LIKE WHEN<br />
IT IS NORMAL</big></p>


<p><i>First</i></p>

<p>In adults; or, in children after the
eruption of teeth and the ingestion of
solid food: The non-liquid and non-gaseous
waste of the human body, which, in its normal
state, is not offensive, should be very small,
in quantity, should be pillular in form, either
separate or massed together; should have no
odour when released, should take on no odour
on standing, should be entirely aseptic (non-poisonous);
should drop freely from the exit,
leaving nothing behind to wash or wipe away.
It <i>may</i> not be collected in the intestines of full-grown
and elderly persons, when normal, as
above, in sufficient quantity to require or necessitate
emptying oftener than from twice a week
to once in two weeks; according to age, activity,
etc.; and should neither invite nor justify
the description “it is not that which goeth into
a man that defileth him but that which cometh
out.”</p>


<p><i>Second</i></p>

<p>Economic Digestion-Ash (solid <i>excreta</i>),
as a daily average for an
adult of 140 lbs. (10 stone; 63.5 kilos), including
moisture, when released, should not weigh
more than two ounces (56.70 grams). An average
of less than one half this amount of waste
has been secured in test experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<p><i>Third</i></p>

<p>The true test of healthy Z is absence
of odour and completeness, ease and
cleanliness of delivery. Frequency or otherwise,
does not so much matter. Quantity too,
is not so important; but with foul odour there
is disturbance, strain and danger.</p>

<p>The normal man is a cleanly being with all
excreta inoffensive; and by these tokens he
may be his own private judge.</p>

<p>Why is it that barn-yards are tolerable to
the human senses while open <i>dépôts</i> of human
excreta are fever-breeding nuisances and intolerable
to beasts and humans alike?</p>

<p>This curse of putrid excreta caused more
deaths from enteric fever during the Boer War
in South Africa than all other causes. It is
equally a menace to health and even to life
while being formed and carried in the body.</p>


<p><i>Fourth</i></p>

<p>Offensive excreta are quite certain
evidence of neglect of the self-controllable
parts of our own nutrition. They are
the tell-tale condemnation of ignorance or carelessness.
Each person should learn to read the
true bulletins of his health conditions in his
waste-products of digestion.</p>


<p>Z</p>

<p>is the form the body <i>must</i> assume to render
emptying of the digestion-ash natural and
easy. Man was built to squat on his heels in
defecating, and sitting erect on a modern seat
is like trying to force a semi-solid through a
kinked hose. <span class="smcap">Healthy Human Excreta are
no more Offensive than Moist Clay and

TO 1906 EDITIONS</h3>
</div>


<p>Since the former introductions were written
much success has been attained in further advancing
the reforms advocated in the <i>A. B. C.
Life Series</i>. Professor Chittenden has published
his report on the Yale experiments in
book form in both America<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and England,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and his results have been accepted in scientific
circles the world over as authoritatively conclusive.</p>

<p>At the present writing the most important
Health Boards of Europe<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> are planning to put the
new standards of dietary economy into practical
use among public charges in a manner that can
only result in benefit to the wards of the nations
as well as make an important saving to the tax-payers.
In the most important of these foreign
public health departments the Health Officer of
the Board has himself practised the newly established
economy for two years, and his plans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
are formulated on personal experience which
fully confirms Professor Chittenden’s report and
that of the author as herein related.</p>

<p>At a missionary agricultural college, situated
near Nashville, Tenn., where the students earn
their tuition and their board while pursuing
their studies, a six months’ test of what is termed
“Fletcherism” resulted in a saving of about one
half of the drafts on the commissary, immunity
from illness, increased energy, strength and endurance,
and general adoption of the suggestions
published in the several books of the author included
in the <i>A. B. C. Life Series</i>.</p>

<p>In the various departments and branches of
the Battle Creek Sanitarium in America, and
widely scattered over the world, some eight
hundred employees and thousands of patients
have been accumulating evidence of the efficacy
of “Fletcherism” for more than three years, and
scarce a month passes without a letter from Dr.
Kellogg to the author containing new testimony
confirming the <i>A. B. C.</i> selections and suggestions.</p>

<p>The author has received within the past two
years more than a thousand letters bearing the
approval of the writers with report of benefits
received which seem almost miraculous, and
these include the leaders in many branches
of human occupation&mdash;physiologists, surgeons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
medical practitioners, artists, business men, literary
workers, athletes, working men and women,
and almost every degree of mental and physical

MONTH’S EXPERIENCE<br />


<small>(<i>Requested and given as a test of effectiveness</i>)</small></h3>
</div>

<p>The entire principle of economic nutrition
is simple and practical. It does not prescribe
that we shall follow any special diet nor do away
with any of our meals. It simply requires you
to throw present habits and conventions to the
winds, and for a little time try the experiment
of giving the matter of your every-day living
honest, intelligent thought.</p>

<p>Eat all you crave, but do not eat more than
this simply because you have been in the habit
of doing so. See to it that each morsel put
into your mouth is thoroughly masticated and
mixed with the saliva before going down into
the stomach, which is not equipped to perform
the work which the teeth and salivary glands
were given you for. The stomach will struggle
bravely to overcome the abuse which you heap
upon it, but in spite of all it can do to manage
hastily chewed food, undigested portions remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
which clog the intestines and interfere with the
healthy conditions which Nature intended.</p>

<p>The appetite is given as an indicator of what
the body requires. If you crave potato, the system
needs starch, which the saliva makes digestible,
but which the acids of the stomach cannot
dissolve. Other needs of the system are similarly
indicated. Take the trouble of asking
your appetite the question, instead of accepting
the conventional number of courses simply
because they are set before you. The appetite
will close the valve when you have eaten enough,
if you will give it a chance.</p>

<p>Suppose your time for eating is limited; in
twenty minutes you could not eat slowly the
luncheon which you usually select. Then eat
that much less. The amount of food which you
can eat and thoroughly masticate in twenty minutes
will give you more nourishment and will
sustain you better than twice the amount thrown
into the stomach in the same manner in which
a man usually packs a trunk.</p>

<p>Why is it that so many men require a
“bracer” at eleven o’clock? Because they have
loaded their stomachs with a heavy breakfast,
and instead of gaining nourishment from it, the
smothered organ is doing its best to tear the
undigested morsels to pieces, that they may
pass into the intestines and prevent sickness, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
even death. The time finally arrives when it
finds itself unable to do this, and then comes
acute indigestion, or something worse, and the
system becomes run down, ready to receive
typhoid, or any other germs which happen to
come along.</p>

<p>Do you know why griddle-cakes hurt you?
Because the syrup, which is cane-sugar,&mdash;and
as such is indigestible,&mdash;is allowed to pass
through the mouth and down into the stomach,
without being properly mixed with the saliva,
which makes it digestible. As soon as it enters
the stomach it becomes acid and interferes with
everything it meets. Had the cakes been properly
masticated and mixed with the saliva, the
cane-sugar would have become grape-sugar, and
in this form it is easily digested.</p>

<p>Why is it that stout people are advised to
avoid starchy foods? Economic nutrition does
not advise this. Potatoes, eaten too hastily,
when not craved by the appetite, supply the
system with a superabundance of starch, and
this is fat-inducing. Potatoes are supposed
to produce fat; but if your appetite craves
potato, and you properly masticate it, eating
only as much of it as satisfies your appetite, the
system absorbs it all, leaving nothing to produce
fat. On this same principle economic
nutrition assures that the same food, taken in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
accordance with its requirements, will add to one
man’s weight and decrease another’s, simply
because proper care of the stomach supplies the
vital organs with the necessary materials to form
each individual person after the model which Nature
intended for him. If Nature intended him
to be slight, economic nutrition will not make
him heavy; if Nature intended him to be muscularly
strong and heavy, economic nutrition will
not reduce his weight. In each case he will enjoy
that perfect condition which Nature intended
him to possess without fat encumbrance.</p>

<p>Did you ever try to reason out why it is
necessary for athletes to go into training? Simply
because, in order to get the best use of their
strength, they are obliged to spend some number
of weeks or months in overcoming false
conditions which they have brought upon themselves.
Any person who lives in accordance
with the simple requirements of economic nutrition
has nothing of this kind to overcome, but
is in perfect condition all the time.</p>

<p>The requirements of economic nutrition are
not hardships but pleasures. Proper mastication
and insalivation (mixing with saliva), give
your sense of taste far greater gastronomic enjoyment
than you have ever before had. If you are
a wine drinker, try insalivating a little port wine;
but it must be good wine, for this is a severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
test. A sip will quench your immediate desire
and give you more pleasure than a whole glass
gulped down. The professional tea-taster does
this in tasting tea; he never allows himself to
drink any tea at all, for drinking anything that
has taste destroys the delicacy of the sense
of taste. But he will tell you that he gets more
real enjoyment out of the little he takes than
he previously gained from drinking a larger
amount. The same thing applies to the professional
wine-tasters; they never drink any wine,
and yet they enjoy the taste of wine as drinkers
never can do. These men adopt this method as
a business; is their commercial advantage of
greater importance than your health and happiness,
and even life itself?</p>

<p>Is it not ridiculous that the average man is
so ignorant of the engine which supplies him
with all his activity and upon which depends
every action of his life? Could you tell, were
you asked, the particular need and purpose of
your last meal and what it is likely to accomplish?
Consider your body as an engine:
would you accept yourself as a competent engineer
on your own examination and confession?
Would you employ a chauffeur to run
your automobile who knew as little about its
mechanism and requirements as you do about
your own stomach? Yet which is of greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
importance? Were you the owner of valuable
live-stock, would you dare entrust their care
to a farm-hand or stableman who knew as little
about their proper feeding as you know
about your own proper feeding or that of your
children?</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped to think why the
excrements are foul and odorous? Simply because
undigested food, which should have been
so masticated as to give the body nourishment,
is thrown off by the stomach into the intestines,
there to decay and produce this unclean condition.
If the dead carcass of a cow is lying in
the road, it is removed before it has an opportunity
to decay and thus become filthy and
dangerous. Yet how much more safe it would
be for the carcass to lie where it was than for
you to take portions of it into your intestines
and allow it to decay there instead of in the
road? In other words, food is intended to be
eaten that nourishment may be gained from it,
and when you only gain a part of the nourishment,
you prostitute your stomach and take tremendous
risks of germ diseases in your body.</p>

<p>These facts are set forward thus simply in
the hope that they may impress the reader as
they have impressed the writer. Economic
nutrition is not a joke, is not a fad; it is
solely an appeal to self-examination and self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>-instruction
in the most vital question of all the
world, since upon perfect nutrition depends not
only health, but strength, mental acuteness,
moral tendencies, attractability to others, happiness,
and, in fact, life itself.</p>

<h3 class="hang">FIRST SCIENTIFIC RECOGNITION OF THE
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC NUTRITION
OUTLINED IN “GLUTTON OR EPICURE”</h3>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>[With the exception of a brief review of <i>Glutton or Epicure</i>,
by Dr. Joseph Blumfield, of London, published in <i>The Lancet</i>,
no scientific or professional recognition of the principles of an
economic nutrition attained by means of thorough buccal
digestion was gained until issue of the following paper by
Dr. Ernest Van Someren, of Venice, Italy.</p>

<p>The previous autumn and winter had been devoted to experiments
by Dr. Van Someren and the writer, in co-operation
with Dr. Professor Leonardi, for twelve years Professor of
Chemistry in the University of Pavia, Italy. In the spring
and summer of 1901 the field of experiments was changed to
Mendel Pass, <i>bei</i> Bozen, Süd Tirol, Austria, and related to
endurance work in climbing mountains and bicycle runs among
the Dolomites.</p>

<p>Dr. Van Someren’s paper attracted the attention of Sir
Michael Foster, Professor of Physiology at the University of
Cambridge, England, and Permanent Honorary President of
the International Congress of Physiologists.</p>

<p>Professor Foster entered into correspondence with Dr. Van
Someren, and this was followed by an invitation to Dr.
Van Someren and the writer to attend the Congress which
was to convene in Turin, Italy, during the month of September
following. At the Congress Dr. Van Someren presented
a technical thesis on the probable causes of the economy attained,
and gave a demonstration of the movement of his
Swallowing Reflex in relation to food in the process of liquefaction
and preliminary digestion in the mouth.</p>

<p>Following the Congress we received an invitation to visit
Cambridge, England, and submit to tests of nitrogenous measurements
in the Physiological Laboratory of the University,
under the direction of Dr. F. Gowland Hopkins; and also to an
examination of the bacterial flora incident to the nitrogenous
estimations, under the direction of Dr. George H. F. Nuttall.</p>

<p>The report of the experiments in the Chemical-Physiological
Department is given in the “<span class="smcap">Note</span>” of Sir Michael Foster,
which follows Dr. Van Someren’s paper, but the bacterial
examination was not carried far enough to warrant a scientific
report, owing to difficulty of obtaining, at the time, sufficient
data.—<span class="smcap">Horace Fletcher.</span>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Paper read before the Physiological Section
of the British Medical Association, August,
1901, by Ernest Van Someren</span></p>


<p><i>Mr. President and Gentlemen:</i></p>

<p>Being a general practitioner, it is with some
trepidation and an apology that I present myself
before this section. The reasons for my doing
so are: First, that I believe that a hitherto
unsuspected reflex in deglutition has come to
light which has an important bearing on health,
the prevention of disease and on metabolism.
Second, that any theory whatever, based on a
possible physiological function, claiming to
diminish, as this does, the amount of sickness
and suffering now existent, should have serious
investigation. Third, that I desire to enlist
your skilled help in the consideration of the
theories I have doubtless crudely erected on
my premise.</p>

<p>According to the “Encyclopædia Britannica,”
“Luigi Cornaro (1467-1566) was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Venetian nobleman, famous for his treatises on a
temperate life. From some dishonesty on the part
of his relatives, he was deprived of his rank and
induced to retire to Padua, where he acquired the
experience in regard to food and regimen which
he has detailed in his work. In his youth he lived
freely, but after a severe illness at the age of
forty, he began under medical advice gradually
to reduce his diet. For some time he restricted
himself to a daily allowance of 12 ozs. of solid
food and 14 ozs. of wine. Later in life he still
farther reduced his bill of fare, and he found
that he could support his life and strength
with no more solid meat than an egg a day. So
much habituated did he become to this simple
diet that when he was about seventy years of
age the addition, by way of experiment, of
2 ozs. a day had nearly proved fatal. At the
age of eighty-three he wrote his treatise on the
‘Sure and Certain Method of Attaining a Long
and Healthful Life.’ And this work was followed
by three others on the same subject, composed
at the ages of eighty-six, ninety-one, and ninety-five,
respectively. ‘They are written,’ says Addison
(‘Spectator,’ No. 195), ‘with such a spirit
of cheerfulness, religion, and good sense, as are
the natural concomitants of temperance and
sobriety.’ He died at the age of ninety-eight.
Some say of 103!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Now, was Luigi Cornaro right? Did he
make use of a physiological process unknown to
us of the value of which he was not cognisant?
To live to an advanced age, must we be as temperate
as he, reducing the quantity of our food
to a minimum required by Nature?</p>

<p>That we all eat more than we can assimilate
is unquestionable. How can we determine the
right quantity? Instinct <i>should</i> guide us, but
an abnormal appetite often leads us astray.
Nature’s plans are perfect if her laws are obeyed.
Disease follows disobedience. Wherein do we
disobey?</p>

<p>We live <i>not</i> upon what we eat, but upon what
we digest; then why should undigested food,
recognisable as such, be deemed a normal
constituent of our solid egesta?</p>

<p>Something like the following must be a common
experience to general practitioners, especially
to those practising on the Continent. The
patient comes to see us and volunteers the information
that he or she has the “gout,”
“rheumatic gout,” or “dyspepsia.” Symptoms
are asked for. The case is gone into carefully
for causation. An appropriate diet and an
appropriate bottle of medicine prescribed. As
the patient leaves the room, we may, or may
not, call attention to the fact that both teeth
and saliva are meant to be used. The patient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
returns, better, <i>in statu quo</i>, or worse. If better,
he remains so while under treatment, and relapses
when he returns to ordinary habits. If
unaffected, or worse, we try again and again,
until we despair, then take or send him to a
consultant. Temporary benefit, possibly owing
to renewed hope, results; but finally the unfortunate
gets used to his sufferings and, if he
can afford it, is sent to join the innumerable
hosts that wander from one <i>Bad</i> to another,
all Europe over, trying, praising, and damning
each in turn. Their manner of living is, of
course, at fault. Nature never intended that
man should be perpetually on a special diet and
hugging a bottle of medicine, nor did she ordain
that he should go wandering over the map of
Europe drinking purgative and other waters.</p>

<p>Though early yet to speak with certain voice,
it would seem that we are provided with a Guard,
reliance on which protects us from the results of
mal-nutrition. There seems to be placed in the
fauces and the back of the mouth a Monitor to
warn us what we ought to swallow and when we
ought to swallow it. The good offices of this
Monitor we have suppressed by habits of too
rapid eating, acquired in infancy or youth.</p>

<p>Last November my attention was called by
Mr. Horace Fletcher, an American author living
in Venice, to the discovery in himself of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
curious inability to swallow, and a closing of the
throat against food, unless it had been completely
masticated. My informant stated that
he noticed this peculiarity after he had begun to
excessively insalivate his food, both liquid and
solid, until all its original taste had been removed
from it. Any tasteless residue in the
mouth, being refused by the fauces, required a
<i>forced</i> muscular effort to swallow. He further
told me that since adopting this method of eating
he had been cured of two maladies, adjudged
chronic, the suffering from which rendered him
ineligible for Life Insurance. His weight now
became reduced from 205 lbs. to 165 lbs. He
had practised no abstemiousness, had indulged
his appetite, both as to selection and to quantity,
without restraint, and for the last three
years had enjoyed perfect health.</p>

<p>After his cure, he was accepted without difficulty
for insurance, the last examination finding
him an unusually healthy subject for his age.
Having leisure, he had spent three years in
investigating the cause of his cure, had pursued
experiments upon others, and had extended his
inquiries, both in America and Europe, until our
meeting in Venice. He had also published a
statement and inquiry in book form, entitled
“Glutton or Epicure,” which had been reviewed
by the “Lancet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>For nearly a year I also had been experimenting
on myself and others with various diets,
and was ready to believe that in the <i>manner</i> of
taking food and not altogether in its varying
<i>matter</i> lay perhaps its protean effects on our
system. I at once adopted the same method of
eating. At the end of six weeks, I noticed that
not only did the fauces refuse to allow of the
passage of imperfectly prepared food, but that
such food was returned from the back to the
front of the mouth by an involuntary, though
eventually controllable, muscular effort taking
place in the reverse direction to that occurring at
the inception of deglutition.</p>

<p>What actually happens is this: Food, as it is
masticated, slowly passes to the back of the
mouth, and collects in the glosso-epiglottidean
folds, where it remains in contact with the
mucous membrane containing the sensory end-organs
of taste. If it be properly reduced by the
saliva it is allowed to pass the fauces,&mdash;a truly
involuntary act of deglutition occurring. Let
the food, however, be too rapidly passed back
to these folds, <i>i.e.</i>, before complete reduction takes
place, and the reflex muscular movement above
referred to occurs. The process of this reflex
is as follows: The tip of the tongue is involuntarily
fixed at the backs and bases of the lower
central incisor teeth by the anterior fibres of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the geniohyoglossi muscles. With this fixed
point as fulcrum, the lower and middle fibres of
these muscles, aided by those of the stylohyoid
and styloglossi muscles raise the hyoid bone,
straighten out the glosso-epiglottidean folds,
passing their contents forward, by the fauces,
the opening of which is closed by approximation
of its pillars and contraction of the
superior constrictor. The tongue, arched postero-anteriorly
by the geniohyoglossi, palato,
and styloglossi muscles, laterally, by its own
intrinsic muscles, is approximated to the fauces,
soft and hard palates in turn, and thus, the
late contents of the glosso-epiglottidean folds
are returned to the front of the mouth for
further reduction by the saliva preparatory to
deglutition.</p>

<p>The word reduction is used for the reason
that all foods tested, without exception, give an
acid reaction to litmus, when served at table.
The reflex muscular movement occurs in the
writer’s case from five to ten times during the
mastication of each mouthful of food, according
to its quantity and its degree of sapidity.
As often as it recurs, the returned food continues
to give an acid reaction, while food
allowed to pass the fauces is alkaline.</p>

<p>Saliva, flowing in response to the stimulation
of taste, seems more alkaline than that secreted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in answer to mechanical tasteless stimulation.
It is found that the removal of original taste
from any given bolus of food coincides with
cessation of salivary flow and complete alkaline
reduction. The fibre of meat, gristle, connective
tissue, the husk of coarse bread and
cellulose of vegetables are carefully separated
by the tongue and buccal muscles and rejected
by the fauces. To swallow any of these necessitates
a <i>forced</i> muscular effort, which is
abnormal.</p>

<p>Adult man was not originally intended to
take his nourishment in a liquid form, consequently
all liquids having taste, such as soup,
milk, tea, coffee, cocoa, and the various forms
of alcohol, must be treated as sapid solids and
insalivated by holding them in the mouth,
moving the tongue gently, with straight up and
down masticatory movements, until their taste
be removed. Water, not having taste, needs
no insalivation and is readily accepted by the
fauces.</p>

<p>In explanation of the phenomenon described,
the following theory is advanced: The fauces,
back of the tongue, epiglottis, in short, those
mucous surfaces in which are placed the sensory
end-organs of taste and “taste-buds” (the distribution
of which, by the way, has yet to be explained),
that these surfaces, readily becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
accustomed to an alkaline contact by excessive
insalivation and consequent complete
alkaline reduction of the food, afterwards resent
an acid contact and express their resentment
by throwing off the cause of offence by the
muscles underlying them.</p>

<p>This phenomenon must not be confused with
the cases of rumination and regurgitation, which
from time to time are recorded. The food in
this case is not swallowed, nor does it pass any
point from which it can be regurgitated. Eighty-one
individuals of different nationalities and from
several classes of society whom we have studied
are now in conscious possession of their reflexes.
These seem readily educated back to normal
functions by all who seriously and patiently
adopt the habit of what seems only at first to
be excessive insalivation.</p>

<p>The dictum “bite your food well” that we
so often use, has no meaning to those suffering
from the results of mal-assimilation and
mal-nutrition, especially should they have few
or no teeth of their own. I make so bold as to
state that dyspepsia <i>et morbi hujus generis omnis</i>
will cease to exist if patients be persuaded to
bite their food until its original taste disappears,
and it is carried away by involuntary deglutition.</p>

<p>The important point of the whole question
seems to be this alkaline reduction of acid food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
before it passes on to meet subsequent digestive
processes elsewhere, which then become alternately
acid and alkaline.</p>

<p>In the first few months of infant life, when
saliva is not secreted, Nature ordains that
mammary secretion be alkaline. With the
eruption of teeth come an abundant flow of
saliva and a synchronous infantile capacity for
managing other foods. This flow of saliva
depends on a thorough demand and use to
maintain its generous supply. It is just at this
time that children learn to bolt their food,&mdash;the
demand fails, with a consequent detriment to
the salivary glands, digestive processes, and the
system generally.</p>

<p>A, B, C, and D were placed on an absolute
milk diet. A drank his milk in the ordinary
way, and at the end of three days begged to
discontinue the experiment owing to disgust
at the monotony of the diet. B, C, and D
continued the experiment for seventeen days,
insalivating the milk, but to a varying extent, B
the least and D the most. Though D took
most milk, he excreted least solid egesta, C
excreting less than B. Can one infer that increased
insalivation of a non-starchy food insured
its better digestion and assimilation? Each subject
took as much milk only as his appetite
demanded, D taking the most, which never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
exceeded two litres daily. The weights of the
subjects after the usual sudden drop of the first
three days remained remarkably even until the
end of the experiment. B, C, and D all relished
the diet, and it satisfied the requirements of their
appetites, but they experienced an increasing
monotony.</p>

<p>As long ago as the seventeenth century,
before the transformation of matter into energy
by the animal organism, known as Metabolism,
was understood, the fact was recognised that by
the lungs, kidneys, skin, and intestines, substances
no longer useful to the organism were
eliminated, the retention of which proved
harmful. The nature of these substances
was unknown, but it was noted that however
much the food was increased the weight
of the body remained the same. In other words,
a state of complete nutritive equilibrium was
maintained.</p>

<p>The following table contains the <i>résumé</i> of two
experiments in which a state of complete nutritive
equilibrium was maintained by individuals
of about the same weight, on widely different
quantities of food similar in quality. The subjects
of the experiments were a laboratory assistant
of Dr. Snyder, of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, and the writer. The experiment
of the former was made primarily to show the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>

<p>The daily diet of Dr. Snyder’s subject consisted
of three and one-half pounds of potatoes,
eight eggs, a pint and a half of milk, and half
a pint of cream. The writer’s diet of twelve
ounces of solid food (like Luigi Cornaro) consisted
of three eggs, the remainder of the twelve
ounces in potatoes, and an equal quantity of
similar liquid food to that taken by Dr. Snyder’s
subject. The exercise of the laboratory assistant
comprised his daily routine of laboratory
work, while that of the writer consisted of six
sets of tennis, or an hour and a half on horseback,
with an hour to an hour and a half’s walk
or climb daily, in addition to much reading and
writing.</p>

<p>In each case complete nutritive equilibrium
was maintained, although the author subsisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
on three-seventeenths of the solid food taken
by the other subject.</p>

<p>Again, cannot one infer that better assimilation
and less waste resulted from the better
preparation of the smaller quantity of food by
insalivation? Surely, too, there must be less
daily strain on the intestinal canal, and body
generally, in getting rid of 18.9 grammes of
inoffensive dry waste, than in getting rid of 204
grammes of humid, decomposing, and offensive
matter.</p>

<p>“Considerable importance has been attached
to the normal action of the bacteria in the
intestines; and it has even been supposed that
the presence of bacteria is essential to life.
Such a view has recently been shown to be
erroneous by an elaborate and painstaking research
carried out by Nuttall and Thierfelder,
who obtained ripe foetal guinea-pigs by means
of Caesarean section carried out under strict
antiseptic precautions. They introduced the
animals immediately into an aseptic chamber
through which a current of filtered air was
aspirated, and fed them hourly on sterilised
milk day and night for over eight days.</p>

<p>“The animals lived, and throve, and increased
as much in weight as healthy normal
animals subjected to a similar diet for the purpose
of controlling the results. Microscopic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
examination at the end of the experiment
showed that the alimentary canal contained no
bacteria of any kind, nor could cultures of any
kind be obtained from it.</p>

<p>“The same authors, in a subsequent paper,
described the extension of their research to
vegetable food. This was also digested in the
absence of bacteria. Under such conditions cellulose
was not attacked. Hence they consider
that the chief function of this material is to give
bulk and proper consistency to the food so as
to suit the conditions of herbivorous digestion.”
(Schäfer’s “Text-Book of Physiology,” vol i.
p. 465.)</p>

<p>Now, inasmuch as bacterial digestion has no
place in the animal economy, surely it can only
occur at the expense of the organism?</p>

<p>Can micro-organic action take place in the
intestines without the production of toxins and
the consequent absorption of these toxins into
the blood?</p>

<p>We know that the metabolism of a cell is
determined by the general physical environment
of the whole organism, by supplies of
oxygen and water, on nervous impulses, and,
what chiefly concerns this argument, on the nature
and amount of the pabulum supplied to it.
This pabulum is derived from the alimentary
canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Are not even those of us who may be enjoying
seemingly the best of health supplying to
our tissues pabulum containing mild toxins, thus
causing an increased katabolic action to occur in
each individual cell of our bodies?</p>

<p>Are not the blood elements, floating in
a plasma containing such toxins, rendered
resistant, weaker, less capable of fulfilling
their functions as carriers and combatants of
disease?</p>

<p>Are not their and our lives, in consequence,
more painful and shorter than they need be?</p>

<p>Would not the elimination of these toxins
render us less liable to disease? And is not
their presence an important element in predisposition
to disease?</p>

<p>When this reflex is restored micro-organisms
get no further than the stomach. They are destroyed
there by the acid gastric juices, then
only stimulated to their full and normal secretion
by the presence of a sufficiency of alkaline
substance. Undigested matter having been
eliminated, micro-organisms, still existing in the
intestines, deprived of their means of subsistence,
decrease, and, in time, may cease to
exist. The body no longer absorbs the toxins
these produced. To this fact may be ascribed
the increase of mental energy, the general physical
betterment, the cessation of morbid cravings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
for food and drink and of those of a sexual
nature, which are noticed and experienced.</p>

<p>What has just been stated is based not entirely
on experimental evidence but somewhat
upon inference. The inference seems justified
because the excreta, more especially of the
intestines, but also of the kidneys and skin,
become almost odourless and entirely inoffensive.
The solid egesta are voided thickly covered
with mucus, leaving the end of the bowel
dry and clean. The sense of cleanliness can
only then be appreciated to the full, for it is
internal as well external. <i>Flatus</i> is no longer
produced. The urine is inoffensive and seems
to be materially changed in quality, as shown
by chemical analysis. Uric acid, the chlorides,
and, more markedly, aromatic sulphates are reduced
in quantity.</p>

<p>Owing to deliberation in eating, necessitated
by this new habit, satiety occurs on the ingestion
of considerably less food. By carefully studying
one’s self I believe it possible to cultivate an instinct
which will regulate not only the quantity
but the quality of food that the body may need,
and that in the <i>normal health</i> of a full-grown
body, no more food either in quantity or quality
should be supplied than suffices to supply diurnal
waste. Any excess must result in pathological
processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Although there results enhanced pleasure in
the taking of all foods, rich and simple, and especially
in the appreciation of good wines, the
quantities of these foods and beverages that suffice
to fully satisfy the appetite are much smaller
than before, while there is a marked preference
for the simpler kinds of food. The writer now
can imagine no more pleasurable meal than
one consisting of good brown bread, eggs, butter,
cheese, and cream. These, with fresh vegetables
and a very little fruit, form his staple
diet. This tendency and preference for simple
foods is the general experience among those who
have recovered their reflexes of deglutition.</p>

<p>Following on the ingestion of a lessened
quantity of food and on its better assimilation,
there is less waste, the egesta are voided less
frequently, sometimes only once in five to eight
days.</p>

<p>The lower bowel is not the reservoir it formerly
was. So hæmorrhoids cease from troubling
and constipation cannot exist. For this
same reason the body, at the beginning of the
practice, commences to approximate to its normal
weight, increasing or decreasing as the
individual’s environment demands.</p>

<p>A few more words only need be said. It has
been easy to state the results of experiments and
observations: but the acquiring of this new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
reflex, while pursuing daily occupations, is not
easy, and needs more than a little patience and
much serious thought. The habits of a lifetime
cannot be changed in a few days or weeks. The
shortest time in which the reflex has been re-established
is four weeks, and this only by avoiding
conversation at meal-time and concentrating
the attention on keeping the food in the mouth
until complete alkaline reduction has taken place
and sapidity has disappeared.</p>

<p>In closing I wish to maintain as a fact, gentlemen,
of the truth of which you will only be
convinced by actual experience, that by the
restoration of this reflex and in complete dependence
on its use, there lies true health, the
establishment of a condition of stable nutrition
and the possible abrogation of two great predisposing
factors of disease, mal-assimilation and
mal-nutrition. Unless there be among you, as
in the “Cities of the Plain,” a parlous minority
who possess this reflex and take your food as
you ought, none of you are in the enjoyment
of such health as you might have. A like punishment
will be meted out to you as was visited
on those cities, for you will all be consumed
long before your day by the unnecessary combustion
in your bodies caused by the circulation
in them of toxins, the product of undigested and
decomposing food.</p>

<p>The writer, bearing in mind the warning suggested
by the Frenchman whose donkey died as
soon as he had reduced his food to a single wisp
of straw, finds that he is taking less and less
food. While his mind is open as to his arriving
at the final diet of Luigi Cornaro, yet it is
easily conceivable that living a similar life of
retirement in a placid environment, it would be
quite possible to do as he did. Hence the
title of this paper and the queries at the
commencement.</p>

<p>The objects in publishing and distributing
this paper are twofold: to make the subject
as widely known as possible, and to solicit the
aid of colleagues in investigating it more fully.</p>

<p>There is ready at the service of the general
practitioner an important and potential therapeutic
agent in the saliva of his patients and in
the use <i>ad finem</i> of their salivary digestions.</p>

<p>By any chance should readers of this paper
wish to ask any questions, the writer will be
happy to communicate with them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[In connection with a report of the Cambridge Examination
the writer wishes to acknowledge the interest and assistance of
Dr. Francis Gowland Hopkins, head of the Physiological-Chemical
Department of the Physiological Laboratory of the
University; Dr. George H. F. Nuttall, in charge of the Bacteriological
Section of the Pathological Laboratory; Mr. Sidney
W. Cole, Mr. Robert Barrett, and Dr. Hubert Higgins,
both for practical work in the laboratory and in serving as test-subjects.
To Dr. Higgins so much is due that it is difficult to
measure. Since our first meeting in Cambridge, Dr. Higgins
has been unremitting in his study of the subject and in consideration
of its application to human betterment. Having
the altruistic temperament inborn and not yet smothered by
disappointment, the good doctor has consecrated himself to
the service of poorer humanity, and his inspiration in so good
a cause is wonderful motive power behind the native desire to
do good. The statement of Dr. Higgins’ experiences in pursuit
of an Economic Nutrition is given in his own manner in
the new edition of <i>Glutton or Epicure</i>, which is being published
coincidently with this volume in the A. B. C. Life Series.</p>

<p>At the time we were in Cambridge, Dr. Hopkins and Mr.
Cole had just published their paper in the <i>Journal of Physiology</i>
(English), describing their isolation of the tryptophane element
of the proteid molecule which had eluded chemists from the
beginning. In tryptophane they found embodied the odourous
indol and skatol which appear so offensively in the putrid
decomposition of proteid. In the excreta of the test-subjects
in our Economic-Nutrition-Inquiry these malodorous substances
did not appear, and hence another question is opened
up to investigation relative to the putridity of human excrement
under ordinary conditions of carelessness, and the
absence of putridity in the case of nutrition accomplished
by aid of thorough buccal treatment of food preparatory to
digestion.</p>

<p>It is a matter of interest, relative to the patience required in
science, to state that Dr. Hopkins and Mr. Cole were fourteen
months searching for the fugitive tryptophane element after
they received their first clew to its whereabouts. When
isolated, tryptophane masses in a substance having the appearance
of silver, but not the solidity of that metal.—<span class="smcap">Horace

<small><span class="smcap">Note by Sir Michael Foster, K.C.B., M.P., F.R.S.</span></small></h3>
</div>

<p>In 1901 Dr. Ernest Van Someren submitted
to the British Medical Association, and afterwards
to the Congress of Physiologists at Turin,
an account of some experiments initiated by
Mr. Horace Fletcher. These experiments went
to show that the processes of bodily nutrition
are very profoundly affected by the preliminary
treatment of the food-stuffs in the mouth, and
indicated that great advantages follow from the
adoption of certain methods in eating. The
essentials of these special methods, stated briefly
and without regard to certain important theoretical
considerations discussed by Dr. Van
Someren, consist of a specially prolonged mastication
which is necessarily associated with an
insalivation of the food-stuffs much more thorough
than is obtained with ordinary habits.</p>

<p>The results brought to light by the preliminary
experimental trials went to show that
such treatment of the food has a most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
effect upon the economy of the body, involving,
in the first place, a very notable reduction in the
amount of food&mdash;and especially of proteid food&mdash;necessary
to maintain complete efficiency.</p>

<p>In the second place this treatment produced,
in the experience of its originators, an increase
in the subjective and objective well-being of
those who practise it, and, as they believe, in
their power of resistance to the inroads of
disease. These secondary effects may indeed
be almost assumed as a corollary of the first
mentioned; because there can be little doubt
that the ingestion of food&mdash;and perhaps especially
of proteid food&mdash;in excess of what is,
under the best conditions, sufficient for maintenance
and activity, can only be deleterious to
the organism, clogging it with waste products
which may at times be of a directly toxic
nature.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1901 Mr. Fletcher and Dr.
Van Someren came to Cambridge with the
intention of having the matter more closely inquired
into, with the assistance of physiological
experts. The matter evoked considerable interest
in Cambridge, and observations were
made not only upon those more immediately
interested, but upon other individuals, some
of whom were themselves medical men and
trained observers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Certain facts were established by these observations,
which, however, are to be looked
upon as still of a preliminary nature. The
adoption of the habit of thorough insalivation
of the food was found in a consensus of opinion
to have an immediate and very striking effect
upon appetite, making this more discriminating,
and leading to the choice of a simple dietary,
and in particular reducing the craving for flesh
food. The appetite, too, is beyond all question
fully satisfied with a dietary considerably less in
amount than with ordinary habits is demanded.</p>

<p>Numerical data were obtained in several
cases, but it is not proposed to deal with these
in detail here, as they need the supplementary
study which will be shortly referred to.</p>

<p>In two individuals who pushed the method to
its limits it was found that complete bodily
efficiency was maintained for some weeks upon
a dietary which had a total energy value of less
than one-half of that usually taken, and comprised
little more than one-third of the proteid
consumed by the average man.</p>

<p>It may be doubted if continued efficiency
could be maintained with such low values as
these, and very prolonged observations would
be necessary to establish the facts. But all
subjects of the experiments who applied the
principles intelligently agreed in finding a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
marked reduction in their needs, and experienced
an increase in their sense of well-being
and an increase in their working powers.</p>

<p>One fact, fully confirmed by the Cambridge
observations, consists in the effect of the special
habits described upon the waste products of the
bowel. These are greatly reduced in amount,
as might be expected; but they are also markedly
changed in character, becoming odourless and
inoffensive, and assuming a condition which
suggests that the intestine is in a healthier and
more aseptic condition than is the case under
ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>Although the experiments hitherto made are,
as already stated, only preliminary in nature
and limited in scope, they establish beyond all
question that a full and careful study of the
matter is urgently called for.</p>

<p>For this fuller study the Cambridge laboratories
do not possess at present either the
necessary equipment or the funds to provide it.
For the detailed study of the physical efficiency
of a man under varying conditions, elaborate
and expensive apparatus is required; and the
advantages claimed for the special treatment of
the food just discussed can only be fully tested
by prolonged and laborious experiments calling
for a considerable staff of workers.</p>

<p>It is of great importance that the mind of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
lay public should be disabused of the idea that
medical science is possessed of final information
concerning questions of nutrition. This is very
far indeed from being the case. Human nutrition
involves highly complex factors, and the
scientific basis for our knowledge of the subject
is but small; where questions of diet are
concerned, medical teaching, no less than
popular practice, is to a great extent based
upon empiricism.</p>

<p>But the scientific and social importance of the
question is clearly immense, and it is greatly to
be desired that its study should be encouraged.</p>

<h3 class="hang">REPORT OF A PLAN FOR THE INSTITUTION
OF AN INTERNATIONAL INQUIRY INTO
THE SUBJECT OF HUMAN NUTRITION</h3>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Sir Michael Foster’s “Note” (preceding) and Professor
Chittenden’s article in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i> (following),
which form a part of this book, show a common want of
exact knowledge relative to human nutrition not at all creditable
to human intelligence at the beginning of the twentieth
century; but they both offer hope of relief from this discreditable
stigma in systematic study of the question. For this
purpose an international inquiry was proposed, a plan was
drawn up under advice of Sir Michael Foster, and the matter
was given to the writer to promote by the best means
available.</p>

<p>The Carnegie Institution seemed, at the time, the most
likely supporter of such a scheme; but owing to an embarrassment
of applications for support of American science needs, it
was considered best not to attempt any foreign or even international
benefaction, for the present at least, and hence other
means of furthering the inquiry were sought.</p>

<p>The invitation of Professor Chittenden to repeat the demonstration
of food-economy made by the author and Dr. Van
Someren at Cambridge, England, of which Sir Michael Foster’s
“Note” treats, at the laboratories of the Sheffield Scientific
School of Yale University, led to the discovery that New
Haven already possessed an equipment suitable for the inquiry
much more complete than the plan Professor Foster had
outlined as being desirable.</p>

<p>At Yale were found not only a very well-adapted chemico-physiological
laboratory with some of the most active and
scientifically respected research talent of the world in charge,
but the laboratory stood only three minutes away from one of
the best furnished gymnasiums in the world, under a director
who is an M. D. of twenty years’ experience, as well as a
famous athlete and author of an athletic manual. It so hap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>pened
that this gymnasium was especially suited for assisting
in a research into the very causes of human efficiency, or lack
of it, which nutrition is supposed to affect.</p>

<p>Only forty minutes from New Haven by rail,&mdash;a distance
not greater, as measured by time separation, than from one
side of London to the other,&mdash;at Middletown, Conn., stood
also the recently completed calorimeter of Professors Atwater
and Benedict ready for making a calorimetric trial-balance
measurement of metabolism attained and chemically estimated
in the tests at New Haven.</p>

<p>After the Yale demonstration, of which Professor Chittenden’s
article, previously mentioned, treats, the author responded
to an invitation from Professor Atwater and submitted himself
to a 32-hour confinement in the calorimeter for confirmation
of the results obtained at New Haven.</p>

<p>This experience in the calorimeter at Middletown was very
significant and instructive. The author was the first test-subject
used in the newly completed calorimeter. The oxygen-measuring
attachment of Dr. Benedict that completed the
apparatus and gave a complete trial balance of the metabolism
of the subject under examination was as yet untried, but it
proved its integrity within the fraction of one per cent and
registered as accurately as necessary for all practical purposes.
So much for the machine; but it measured a result which is
of the greatest importance to the human race. The author
had just demonstrated the possibility of running the human
machine on half the heat, on one-third of the fuel, and with
only one-tenth of the waste, as represented by the waste, or
ashes of digestion. Not only was this done while in pursuit
of the ordinary activity of present-day life, but under stress of
’Varsity-Crew exercise, as reported by Professor Chittenden
and Dr. Anderson. Had this demonstration been made relative
to steam engines or electrical motors, the information
would have been revolutionary in establishing new values for
things industrial and commercial.</p>

<p>Its significance relative to human profitable possibilities
is even more important than if related to steam or electrical
power. The possibility of economy in the human machine
gives also a hope of immunity from the common diseases
which now afflict mankind.</p>

<p>The trial of the calorimeter as a measuring machine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the trial balance of the economic metabolism which the author
had attained by five years of careful attention to the natural
requirements of nutrition were epoch-making events coincidently
related, and for them the author here makes this distinguished
claim&mdash;not on account of any accomplishment of
himself, but as a promise of great possibilities for human
betterment.</p>

<p>Here follows a reproduction of the plan just referred to,
with <i>fac-simile</i> of the signatures of the distinguished physiologists
who approved the plan and consented to serve as “Assessors.”
To this list should have been added the name of
Professor Ozawa, professor of physiology at the University of
Tokio, Japan; but time and distance did not permit gaining
the required understanding and assent. Professor Ozawa’s
connection with the inquiry would make it not only international
but interhemispherical and interracial as well, and
this possibility of scientific coördination and coöperation is
typical of the harmonising wave that is fast enveloping the
earth for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>I give a copy of the document entire, with estimates of
cost, etc., just as it was originally drawn and intended only as
a trial suggestion, to be modified by circumstances.—<span class="smcap">Horace

<h3 class="hang">PROPOSAL TO FOUND AN INTERNATIONAL
LABORATORY OF
RESEARCH FOR THE STUDY OF
NUTRITION IN ALL ITS ASPECTS</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding the enormous development
which the study of Experimental Physiology has
undergone during the last half-century, and the
constant multiplication of physiological laboratories
fitted in a manner which enables them to
be used as places of research as well as of
instruction in the methods of physiological in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>quiry,
it has appeared to many physiologists
that a great need remains to be supplied by the
establishment of an International Laboratory of
Research, devoted primarily, if not exclusively,
to the investigation of problems connected with
the Nutrition of the Animal, and particularly of
Human Organisms,&mdash;studies particularly, and
in the first instance, from the point of view of the
relation of the food consumed by the animal
body to its output of energy, either in the form
of heat or mechanical work.</p>

<p>The reason for establishing such a laboratory,
available for the use of investigations of all
nations, is to be found in the fact that the researches
which are now called for, in order to
place upon a firm foundation our knowledge of
food and its relations to the activity of the organism,
necessitates an assemblage of apparatus and
machinery so specialised and so costly that they
are not to be found collected together even in the
best equipped of the physiological laboratories
of Europe or America, which all subserve in the
first instance the purposes of systematic instruction.
Undoubtedly, unquestionably, certain of
the great and costly appliances of research are
to be found in particular laboratories, as, for instance,
in those of Berlin, Munich, Paris, and
Turin, but there certainly exists no laboratory
in which the investigator can find assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
under one roof all the specially fitted chemical,
physical, and even bacteriological appliances
which he may need to employ in the investigation
of the Phenomena of Nutrition.</p>

<p>A more precise conception of the nature of
the proposed laboratory may be formed if reference
is made to certain groups of appliances
which such a laboratory should possess and be
able to place at the disposal of the scientific
men coming to it for facilities which may be
denied them at home. It should possess a
complete set of respiration chambers of various
types, and especially should be provided with
the “Atwater Respiration Apparatus;” the
most perfect appliances for the analyses of gases
should be available; it should be provided with
the most perfect calorimeters of various types,
both for the investigation of the calorimetric
value of the foods experimented on, and for the
determination of the heat produced by man or
by the lower animals,&mdash;the subjects of observation.
The laboratory should possess, besides,
the most perfect appliances for the measurement
of work done by man and by animals
(“ergostat,” “ergograph”), and a set of balances
of the highest perfection capable of weighing
with accuracy very heavy loads. These
characteristic appliances of a laboratory specially
designed for placing our knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Animal Nutrition on a thoroughly sound basis
must be superadded to the ordinary means for
pursuing with success researches in Pure Organic,
Physiological, and Physical Chemistry, as
well as in Bacteriology.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Outline of the Proposed Subjects Of
Research to be Undertaken in the
Proposed International
Laboratory</span></h4>

<p>1. To determine with greater precision than
has yet been possible the efficiency of the animal
organism considered as a machine in which
potential energy of the organic constituents of
food is converted into mechanical work. The
knowledge that we already possess has shown
that in the animal we have an engine infinitely
more efficient as a utiliser of the potential energy
supplied to it than any appliance yet constructed,
or which we can, in the present state
of physical science, construct. A still more precise
study of the actual efficiency of the animal
as a whole, as well as of certain of the vital organs
which are mainly concerned in mechanical
work, and a more thorough investigation of the
processes whereby&mdash;for instance, in the muscles&mdash;the
potential energy of stored-up chemical
compounds is, as appears certain, directly converted
into mechanical work, is not only desira<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>ble
in the interest of the ultimate object of the
work of the Laboratory, but possesses a high
degree of theoretical interest, even from the
point of view of Pure Physics. To sum up:
One of the first objects of the investigations to
be carried out in the projected Laboratory
should be “the more precise determination of
the minimum transformation of energy which
corresponds to mean and accurately determined
conditions of the animal body, and of that of
man in particular.”</p>

<p>2. We are acquainted with the fact that the
potential energy which is utilised by the animal
is supplied to it with the least wear and tear to,
or strain upon, its mechanism by non-nitrogenous
organic constituents of food which must
belong to the groups of starches and sugars or
fats, but that the continued existence of the
organism demands, as an essential condition,
the introduction of a certain proportion of albuminous
matter. In spite of numerous very fine
investigations on this subject, the yet more
precise determination of the minimum quantity
of the albuminous constituents which are absolutely
necessary or desirable, under the most
varying conditions, is eminently desirable, especially
in the light of recently recorded facts,
amongst which are those to be referred to
under 3 (following):—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>3. Certain very noteworthy observations
made by Messrs. Horace Fletcher and Ernest
H. Van Someren have shown that an excessively
prolonged mastication and insalivation of food
leads to remarkable results in respect to the
diminution of the total quantity of food necessary
to keep the body in a state of health, and
to, as is alleged, a remarkable improvement in
the digestive functions as well as of the general
health of the individual. It appears highly important
thoroughly to investigate the remarkable
phenomena discovered by Messrs. Fletcher and
Van Someren, and to determine how far they
may lead to a modification of or improvement
in the dietary of healthy individuals and of persons
in a state of disease.</p>

<p>4. Indeed, it may truly be said that the average
diet of man, that is to say, the absolute and
relative amount of certain food-stuffs on which
an average man should live, is at present, to a
large extent, determined in an empirical manner.
It is most necessary that this should be determined
in an exact manner, since it is at least
possible that a more complete knowledge may
reveal that the good results thus obtained empirically
are only reached by means of an excess
of one element being counterbalanced by excess
of another element, and thus open up a way to
considerable economy. The changes needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
for variations from the average, to meet certain
conditions, are also at present, to a very large
extent, determined empirically, and these also
most certainly ought to be determined in an absolutely
exact manner.</p>

<p>5. The researches of Pawlow on the conditions
which influence the activity of the secreting
glands of the organs of digestion, upon the
relation of their activity to the nature of the food
ingested, upon the influence exerted by the secretion
of the glands situated in one part of the
alimentary canal, upon the activity of glands
situated lower down, indicate lines of research
only recently opened out, but the importance
of which in reference to the problems of nutrition
is probably great.</p>

<p>6. Similarly, the facts which have in recent
times been ascertained in reference to the remarkable
influence exerted by the so-called
“internal secretion” of certain ductless glands
on the general metabolism, the part played by
the pancreas in reference to the transformations
of sugar in the body indicate yet other lines of
research to be carried out in connection with
the main inquiry.</p>

<p>In conclusion: The final problem of the
work of the proposed Laboratory will be to ascertain
the conditions which will “render it possible
to obtain from the human machine, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
varying conditions, the highest efficiency at the
least cost.”</p>

<p>The value of results which may be thus
obtained, considered from the point of view of
social, political, and administrative economy, is
hardly to be exaggerated.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Suggestions as to Staff and Personnel
of the Proposed International
Laboratory</span></p>

<p>For the coördination and general direction
of the several investigations, the services of an
eminent physiological chemist (preferably one
having the principal European languages at his
command) is essential.</p>

<p>Such a director would need at least two efficient
permanent technical assistants, as for instance,
one to deal with the problems of Organic
Chemistry, and another competent to deal with
the problems of Physical Chemistry. Other
assistants might be necessary, but it would
probably be desirable that the Institute should
have the power of subsidising, for a longer or
shorter period, men who would undertake special
investigations in coördination with the general
work, and who would thus be, as it were, temporary
assistants. This would be quite apart
from the general hospitality of the Laboratory
offered by the Institute to other investigators.</p>

<p>With regard to the second item, the permanent

but the temporary assistants would be taken
on as opportunity offered. Less than even the

<p>Regarding the third item, also, the maximum
might not be required in the beginning.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Suggestions as to Desirability of Location</span></h4>

<p>The place fitted for the establishment of an
International Institute should be one which can
be reached with comparative facility by investigators
of the different nationalities. It must be
one free from the objections due to national susceptibilities.
It should also be, if possible, a
place agreeable to live in; a place where work
can be carried on through the year; and a place
where expenses, both the personal expenses of
the investigators, and the general expenses of the
Institute, are not excessive. Venice has been
suggested as a place fulfilling the above require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>ments.
It can be reached readily from all parts
of Europe, and is as accessible to Americans as
any other European city. Living is very cheap,
and, indeed, all expenses are very moderate.</p>

<p>On sea level itself, Venice is within near distance
of very high altitude, and hence offers
facilities for the study of the effects of climatic
influence on nutrition. It is also sufficiently
near the Regina Margherita Laboratory, on
Monte Rosa, to enable the observations made
at the two places to be coördinated. Venice is,
moreover, a cosmopolitan centre; and persons
of many different nations and races might readily
be obtained as subjects for observation and
experiment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be regarded as
essential to the complete success of the proposed
Institute that both the director and those
engaged in investigation should have ample opportunities
of ready and frequent intercourse
with eminent men engaged in investigation in
Physics, Chemistry, and the allied sciences. The
help which is thus gained by intercourse
with men at the very head of various scientific inquiry
cannot be supplied in any other way. There is
also an urgent reason for ready access to a most
thoroughly equipped scientific library. It is
also essential that the Institute should have
facility of obtaining, or of getting constructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
with the least possible delay such apparatus as
it might need. These essentials cannot be supplied
otherwhere than in great centres of scientific
activity. A small university cannot supply
them. If they are insisted on, the Institute
must be located in a place which has metropolitan
distinction and holds not only a large
but an active university. The choice of a situation,
from this point of view, in Europe, is thus
almost limited to such places as Paris, Berlin,
Vienna, or London. Of these London probably
best recommends itself for international
purposes.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, London is distinctly
an expensive place to live in. Indeed, all expenses
there are great, and the same may be
said of any great metropolitan centre. Moreover,
London cannot be reached from the countries
of Europe without sea transit.</p>

<p>The choice between such a place as London
and such a place as Venice must depend upon
the relative weight attached, on the one hand, to
the scientific advantages dwelt on above, and,
on the other hand, to the advantages other than
scientific.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Suggestions as to Management of the
Proposed International Institute</span></h4>

<p>It is proposed that: First, there should be a
small body of trustees who should undertake the
financial responsibility; and, Second, a board
of scientific assessors, representing several nations,
who, in conjunction with the director,
should exercise general supervision of the work
of the Institute. Such a board need meet only
at rare intervals, much being done by way of
correspondence. The expenses which the members
incur in the exercise of their functions ought
to be met out of the funds of the Institute.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Notwithstanding the report of the Cambridge examination
of the claims for an economic nutrition advanced by the
authors, American physiologists were still doubtful if a nitrogenous
economy like that reported could be maintained, and
the writer was invited to submit to further tests at the Physiological
Laboratory of Yale University, under direction of
Professor Russell H. Chittenden, Director of the Sheffield
Scientific School, and President of the American Physiological
Society, and Dr. Lafayette B. Mendel.</p>

<p>The following article, first published in the <i>Popular
Science Monthly</i>, June, 1903, is a report of that test, and indicates
a desire to carry the investigation further to include
a variety of test-subjects.</p>

<p>In response to Professor Chittenden’s request, the Trustees
of the Bache Fund of the National Academy of Sciences
appropriated $1000 towards a more extended inquiry; and
other means having been assured, a project of experiments
was taken under consideration.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties encountered was the control of
test-subjects for a sufficiently long time to make conclusive
estimates relative to the minimum needs of nitrogenous food
in relation to the common occupations of life. Few if any
volunteers, with the leisure and interest fortunately possessed
by the writer, were available outside the laboratory force
itself, and there were serious objections to using for test-subjects
the same persons who did the chemical analyses and
estimated the results.</p>

<p>In this dilemma the good fortune of a meeting with Surgeon-General
O’Reilly of the United States Army and with
General Leonard Wood&mdash;the former on his way to Madrid to
attend a medical congress, and the latter <i>en route</i> to the
Philippines to take command there&mdash;happened to the writer
on the S. S. <i>Commonwealth</i>, on a voyage to Italy in April,
1903.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Both these officers are medical men and research enthusiasts.
They had fought yellow fever together, in coöperation
with martyr Dr. Major Walter Reed, in Cuba, and the fame
of their success was being talked of as one of the great
triumphs of pathologic, or hygienic, science at the time of
the meeting.</p>

<p>There was ample time on the steamer to discuss a subject
of such mutual and general interest, and both officers had
had, in service, experiences that led them to believe that the
results obtained by the writer and his colleagues were the
common possibilities of all persons under right conditions of
alimentation.</p>

<p>General O’Reilly was of the opinion that the corps he commanded
could furnish intelligent and earnest test-subjects for
nutrition investigation, as it did in the yellow fever case. In
the yellow fever investigation privates and officers alike had
volunteered to act as test-subjects, even though their lives
were at stake and many had already been sacrificed. It is
to their great honour, also, that they refused to receive the
bounty that was offered for test-subjects, preferring to serve
science and humanity freely as volunteers rather than sell
themselves as experimental risks. From such material General
O’Reilly was sure that capable assistants could be secured
to test the not at all dangerous or disagreeable economies of
nutrition that the projected inquiry wished to solve.</p>

<p>Armed with letters of recommendation to the President
and to the Secretary of War from General Wood, and an
invitation from Surgeon-General O’Reilly to call on him if
coöperation on his part were desired, the writer returned to
the United States and consulted with Professors Chittenden
and Bowditch relative to the desirability of army coöperation.
It was believed to be just the thing wanted to facilitate the
inquiry, and the writer proceeded to Washington to effect the
combination.</p>

<p>General O’Reilly had already had the matter under consideration
and was quite ready to draw up a project for presentation
to the Secretary of War when Mr. Root should
return to Washington from his summer vacation.</p>

<p>Twenty privates and three non-commissioned officers of
the Hospital Corps of the United States Army under command
of Dr. Lieutenant Wallace DeWitt are now quartered at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
New Haven in coöperation with the staff of the Sheffield
Scientific School. It is the intention to learn, if possible, how
little nitrogen is necessary to secure the best human efficiency;
and also, if possible, to ascertain some measure of the evil
effects of an excess of nitrogenous food as well as excess of
food in general upon human efficiency.</p>

<p>The writer is grateful for the good fortune of being able to
be of service in a development of interest in a subject which
is of vital importance to the human race. He has enjoyed
the benefits of an economic nutrition and knows its value.</p>

<p>The practical proof of a subject of personal application must
come from such personal application. Each person must be
his own doctor and his own scientist in the matter of his alimentation
or he runs the risk of running amuck in his health
economy. There is not so much to learn, neither is there very
much to do to insure right alimentation, perfect digestion,
and continuous good health; but the little required of us
must be attended to with no lapses of attention.—<span class="smcap">Horace

<p>Among the many problems awaiting solution,
none is of greater importance for the
welfare of the individual and of the race than
that which relates to the proper nutrition of the
body. Man eats to live and to gain strength
for his daily work, and without sufficient nutriment
the machinery of the body cannot be run
smoothly or with proper efficiency. The taking
of an excess of food, on the other hand, is just
as harmful as insufficient nourishment, involving,
as it does, not only wasteful expenditure but,
what is even of greater moment, an expenditure
of energy on the part of the body, which may in
the long run prove disastrous. While it is the
function of food to supply the material from
which the body can derive the necessary energy
for its varied activities, any excess of food over
and above what is needed to make good the
loss incidental to life and daily activity is just so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
much of an incubus, which is bound to detract
from the smooth running of the machinery and
to diminish the fitness of the body for performing
its normal functions.</p>

<p>A proper physiological condition begets a
moral, mental, and physical fitness which cannot
be attained in any other way. Further, it must
be remembered that lack of a proper physiological
condition of the body is more broadly
responsible for moral, social, mental, and physical
ills than any other factor that can be named.
Poverty and vice on ultimate analysis may often
be traced to a perversion of nutrition. A
healthy state of the body is a necessary concomitant
of mental and moral vigour, as well as
of physical strength. Abnormal methods of
living are often the accompaniment or forerunner
of vicious tastes that might never have
been developed under more strictly physiological
conditions. Health, strength (mental and
physical), and moral tone alike depend upon
the proper fulfilment of the laws of nature, and
it is the manifest duty of a people hoping for
the fullest development of physical, mental, and
moral strength to ascertain the character of
these laws with a view to their proper observance.
Poverty, crime, physical ills, and a blunted
or perverted moral sense are the penalties we
may be called upon to pay for the disobedience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
to Nature’s laws; penalties which not only <i>we</i>
may have to pay, but which may be passed
down to succeeding generations, thereby influencing
the lives of those yet unborn.</p>

<p>There is to-day great need for a thorough
physiological study of those laws of nutrition
which constitute the foundation of good living.
It is a subject full of interest and promise for
the sociologist and economist, as well as for the
physiologist. We need a far more complete
knowledge than we possess at present of the
laws governing nutrition; we need fuller knowledge
of the methods by which the most complete,
satisfactory, and economical utilisation of
the diet can be obtained; we need to know
more concerning the minimum diet and the
minimum amount of proteid or albuminous foods
on which health, mental and physical vigour can
be permanently maintained; we need to know
more fully concerning the influence of various
forms of food on growth and recuperative
power; we need more complete knowledge regarding
the rôle of various dietetic and digestive
habits, fixed or acquired; the effects of thorough
mastication, insalivation, and the influence
of two versus three meals a day upon the
utilisation of food and hence upon the bodily
health. Further, we need more concise information
as to the effect of the mental state upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
digestion and nutrition. These and many other
problems of a like nature confront us when we
attempt to trace the influence of a proper nutrition
upon the condition of the body. These
problems, however, all admit of solution, and
in their solution undoubtedly lies the remedy
for many of the personal ills of mankind.</p>

<p>The foregoing thoughts have been suggested
by observations recently made in the writer’s
laboratory on the amount and character of the
food actually required by a healthy man in the
maintenance of bodily equilibrium in periods
of rest and physical work. Our ideas at present
are based primarily upon observations as to
what civilised peoples are accustomed to do,
and not upon what they need to do in order to
meet the demands made upon the body. Sir
William Roberts has well said that the palate is
the dietetic conscience, but he adds that there
are many misfit palates, and we may well query
whether our dietetic consciences have not become
generally perverted through a false mode
of living. The well-nigh universal habit of
catering to our appetite on all occasions, of bowing
to the fancied dictates of our palates even
to the extent of satiety, and without regard to
the physiological needs of the body, may quite
naturally have resulted in a false standard of
living, in which we have departed widely from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the proper laws of nutrition. Statistical studies
carried out on large groups of individuals by
various physiologists have led to the general
acceptance of dietary standards, such as those
proposed by Voit, of Munich, and Atwater in
this country. Thus the Voit diet for a man
doing moderate work is 118 grams of proteid or
albuminous food, 56 grams of fat, and 500 grams
of carbohydrates, such as sugar and starch, with
a total fuel value of 3,055 large calories or heat
units per day. With hard work, Voit increases
the daily requirement to 145 grams of proteid,
160 grams of fat, and 450 grams of carbohydrates,
with a total fuel value of 3,370 large
calories. Atwater, on the other hand, from his
large number of observations, is inclined to
place the daily proteid requirement at 125
grams, with sufficient fat and carbohydrate to
equal a total fuel value of 3,500 large calories
for a man doing a moderate amount of work;
while for a man at hard work the daily diet is
increased to 150 grams of proteid, and with fats
and carbohydrates to yield a total fuel value of
4,500 large calories. These standards are very
generally accepted as being the requirement for
the average individual under the given conditions
of work, and it may be that these figures
actually represent the daily needs of the body.
Suppose, on the other hand, that we have in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
these figures false standards, or, in other words,
that the quantities of food-stuffs called for are
altogether larger than the actual demands of
the body require. In this case there is a positive
waste of valuable food material which we
may calculate in dollars and cents; a loss of income
incurred daily which might be expended
more profitably in other directions. To the
wage-earner with a large family, who must of
necessity husband his resources, there is in our
hypothesis a suggestion of material gain not to
be disregarded. The money thus saved might
be expended for the education of the children,
for the purchase of household treasures tending
to elevate the moral and mental state of the
occupants, or in many other ways that the imagination
can easily supply. This kind of saving,
however, is purely a question of economy, and
in some strata of society would be objected to
as indicative of a condition of sordidness. It
has come to be a part of our personal pride to
have a well-supplied table, and to eat largely
and freely of the good things provided. The
poorer man takes pride in furnishing his family
with a diet rich in expensive articles of food, and
imagines that by so doing he is inciting them to
heartier consumption and to increased health and
strength. He would be ashamed to save in this
way, under the honest belief that by so doing he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
might endanger the health of his dear ones. But
let us suppose that this hypothetical waste of food
is not merely uneconomical, that it is undesirable
for other and weightier reasons. Indeed, let us
suppose that this unnecessary consumption of
food is distinctly harmful to the body, that it is
physiologically uneconomical, and that in our
efforts to maintain a high degree of efficiency
we are in reality putting upon the machinery of
the body a heavy and entirely uncalled-for strain,
which is bound to prove more or less detrimental.
If there is truth in this assumption, our hypothesis
takes on a deeper significance, and we
may well inquire whether there are any reasonable
grounds for doubting the accuracy of our
present dietary standards.</p>

<p>In this connection it is to be remembered
that the food of mankind may be classified under
three heads, viz., <i>proteid or albuminous</i>, such as
meat, eggs, casein of milk, gluten of bread, and
various vegetable proteids; <i>carbohydrates</i>, as
sugar and the starches of our cereals, and <i>fats</i>,
including those of both animal and vegetable
origin. The proteids are characterised by containing
nitrogen (about 16 per cent), while the
fats and carbohydrates contain only carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. The two latter classes of
food-stuffs are burned up in the body, when
completely utilised, to carbonic acid (a gas) and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
water, while the proteid foods, beside yielding
carbonic acid and water, give off practically all
of their nitrogen in the form of crystalline nitrogenous
products in the excreta of the body.
Proteid foods have a particular function to
perform, viz., to supply the waste of proteid
matter from the active tissues of the body, and
this function can be performed only by the
proteid foods; hence the latter are essential
food-stuffs without which the body cannot long
survive. Fats and carbohydrates, on the other
hand, are mainly of value for the energy they
yield on oxidation, and in this connection it is
to be remembered that the fuel value of fats per
gram is much larger than that of carbohydrates,
viz., 9.3: 4.1, or more than twice as great. Further,
it is to be noted that the various food-stuffs
cannot be utilised directly by the body, but they
must first be digested, then absorbed and assimilated,
after which they gradually, in their
changed form, undergo decomposition with liberation
of their contained energy, which may
manifest itself in the form of heat or of mechanical
work. The thoroughness with which foods are
digested and utilised in the body must therefore
count for a great deal in determining their dietetic
or nutritive value. Moreover, it is easy to see
how an excess of proteid food will give rise to
a large proportion of nitrogenous waste matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
which, floating through the system prior to
excretion, may, by acting on the nervous system
and other parts of the body, produce disagreeable
results. A mere excess of food, even of
the non-nitrogenous variety, must entail a large
amount of unnecessary work, thereby using up
a proportional amount of energy for its own disposal,
since once introduced into the body it must
be digested and absorbed, otherwise it undergoes
fermentation and putrefaction in the stomach
and intestines, causing countless troubles.
When absorbed in quantities beyond the real
needs of the body, it may be temporarily deposited
as fat; but why load up the system with
unnecessary material, thereby interfering with
the free running of the machinery? In other
words, it is very evident that the taking in of
food in quantities beyond the physiological requirements
is undesirable, and may prove exceedingly
injurious. It is truly uneconomical,
and defeats the very ends we aim to attain.
Instead of adding to the bodily vigour and
increasing the fitness of the organism to do its
daily work, we are really hampering the delicate
mechanism, upon the smooth running of which
so much depends.</p>

<p>Why, now, should we assume that a daily
diet of over 100 grams of proteid, with fats and
carbohydrates sufficient to make up a fuel value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
of over 3,000 large calories, is a necessary requisite
for bodily vigour and physical and mental
fitness? Mainly because of the supposition that
true dietary standards may be learned by observing
the relative amounts of nutrients actually
consumed by a large number of individuals so
situated that the choice of food is unrestricted.
But this does not constitute very sound evidence.
It certainly is not above criticism. We may
well ask ourselves whether man has yet learned
wisdom with regard to himself, and whether his
instincts or appetites are to be entirely trusted
as safe guides to follow in the matter of his
own nutrition. The experiments of Kumagawa,
Sivén, and other physiologists, have certainly
shown that men may live and thrive, for a time
at least, on amounts of proteid per day equal
to only one-half and one-quarter the amount
called for in the Voit standard. Sivén’s experiments,
in particular, certainly indicate that the
human organism can maintain itself in nitrogenous
equilibrium with far smaller amounts of
proteid in the diet than is ordinarily taught, and,
further, that this condition can be attained without
unduly increasing the total calories of the
food intake. Such investigations, however, have
always called forth critical comment from writers
on nutrition, indicating a reluctance to depart
from the current doctrines of the Voit or Munich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
school; and, indeed, it may justly be claimed
that the ordinary nutrition experiments, extending
over short periods of time, are not entirely
adequate to prove the effect of a given set of
conditions when the latter are continued for
months or years. Thus, Schäfer writes: “It
may be doubted whether a diet which includes
considerably less proteid than 100 grams for the
twenty-four hours could maintain a man of
average size and weight for an indefinite time.
It has frequently been asserted that many Asiatics
consume a very much smaller proportion
of proteid than is the case with Europeans.
The inhabitants of India, Japan, and China
chiefly consume rice as the normal constituent
of their diet, which contains relatively little proteid;
and this has been advanced as an argument
in favour of the view that the minimal
amount of proteid is much less than that ordinarily
given as essential to the maintenance of
nutritive equilibrium. It must, however, be
stated that we have no definite statistics to
show that, in proportion to their body-weight,
Asiatics doing the same amount of work as
Europeans require a less amount of proteids;
indeed such evidence as is forthcoming is rather
in favor of the opposite view.” This statement
is typical of the attitude of physiologists in
general on this important subject. Why not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
candidly admit that the matter is in doubt, and,
with a due recognition of the importance of the
subject, attempt to ascertain the real truth of
the matter?</p>

<p>The writer has had in his laboratory for
several months past a gentleman (H. F.) who
has for some five years, in pursuit of a study of
the subject of human nutrition, practised a certain
degree of abstinence in the taking of food
and attained important economy with, as he believes,
great gain in bodily and mental vigour,
and with marked improvement in his general
health. Under his new method of living he finds
himself possessed of a peculiar fitness for work
of all kinds, and with freedom from the ordinary
fatigue incidental to extra physical exertion.
In using the word abstinence possibly a wrong
impression is given, for the habits of life now
followed have resulted in the disappearance of
the ordinary craving for food. In other words,
the gentleman in question fully satisfies his appetite,
but no longer desires the amount of food
consumed by most individuals.</p>

<p>For a period of thirteen days, in January,
he was under observation in the writer’s laboratory,
his excretions being analysed daily with a
view to ascertaining the exact amount of proteid
consumed. The results showed that the average
daily amount of proteid metabolised was 41.25<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
grams, the body-weight (165 pounds) remaining
practically constant. Especially noteworthy,
also, was the very complete utilisation of the
proteid food during this period of observation.
It will be observed here that the daily amount
of proteid food taken was less than one half that
of the minimum Voit standard, and it should also
be mentioned that this apparent deficiency in
proteid food was not made good by any large
consumption of fats or carbohydrates. Further,
there was no restriction in diet. On the contrary,
there was perfect freedom of choice, and
the instructions given were to follow his usual
dietetic habits. Analysis of the excretions
showed an output of nitrogen equal to the
breaking down of 41.25 grams of proteid per
day as an average, the extremes being 33.06
grams and 47.05 grams of proteid.</p>

<p>In February a more thorough series of observations
was made, involving a careful analysis
of the daily diet, together with analysis of
the excreta, so that not alone the proteid consumption
might be ascertained, but likewise the
total intake of fats and carbohydrates. The
diet consumed was quite simple, and consisted
merely of a prepared cereal food, milk, and
maple sugar. This diet was taken twice a day
for seven days, and was selected by the subject
as giving sufficient variety for his needs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
quite in accord with his taste. No attempt was
made to conform to any given standard of quantity,
but the subject took each day such amounts
of the above foods as his appetite craved. Each
portion taken, however, was carefully weighed
in the laboratory, the chemical composition of
the food determined, and the fuel value calculated
by the usual methods.</p>

<p>The following table gives the daily intake of
proteids, fats, and carbohydrates for six days,
together with the calculated fuel value, and also
the nitrogen intake, together with the nitrogen
output through the excreta. Many other data
were obtained showing diminished excretion of
uric acid, ethereal sulphates, phosphoric acid,
etc., but they need not be discussed here.</p>

<p>The main things to be noted in these results
are, first, that the total daily consumption of
proteid amounted on an average to only 45<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
grams, and that the fat and carbohydrate were
taken in quantities only sufficient to bring the
total fuel value of the daily food up to a little
more than 1,600 large calories. If, however, we
eliminate the first day, when for some reason
the subject took an unusually small amount of
food, these figures are increased somewhat, but
they are ridiculously low compared with the
ordinarily accepted dietary standards. When
we recall that the Voit standard demands at
least 118 grams of proteid and a total fuel value
of 3,000 large calories daily, we appreciate at
once the full significance of the above figures.
But it may be asked, was this diet at all adequate
for the needs of the body&mdash;sufficient for a man
weighing 165 pounds? In reply, it may be said
that the appetite was satisfied, and that the subject
had full freedom to take more food if he so
desired. To give a physiological answer, it
may be said that the body-weight remained
practically constant throughout the seven days’
period, and further, it will be observed by comparing
the figures of the table that the nitrogen
of the intake and the total nitrogen of the output
were not far apart. In other words, there
was a close approach to what the physiologist
calls nitrogenous equilibrium. In fact, it will be
noted that on several days the nitrogen output
was slightly less than the nitrogen taken in. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
are, therefore, apparently justified in saying
that the above diet, simple though it was in
variety, and in quantity far below the usually
accepted requirement, was quite adequate for
the needs of the body. In this connection it
may be asked, what were the needs of the body
during this seven days’ period? This is obviously
a very important point. Can a man on
such a diet, even though it suffices to keep up
body-weight and apparently also physiological
equilibrium, do work to any extent? Will there
be under such condition a proper degree of fitness
for physical work of any kind? In order
to ascertain this point, the subject was invited
to do physical work at the Yale University
Gymnasium, and placed under the guidance of
the director of the gymnasium, Dr. William G.
Anderson. The results of the observations
there made are here given, taken verbatim from
Dr. Anderson’s report to the writer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th of February, 1903, I gave
to Mr. Horace Fletcher the same kind of exercises we
give to the Varsity Crew. They are drastic and fatiguing
and cannot be done by beginners without soreness and
pain resulting. The exercises he was asked to take were
of a character to tax the heart and lungs, as well as to
try the muscles of the limbs and trunk. I should not
give these exercises to Freshmen on account of their
severity.</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher has taken these movements with an ease
that is unlooked for. He gives evidence of no soreness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
or lameness, and the large groups of muscles respond
the second day without evidence of being poisoned by
Carbon dioxide. There is no evidence of distress after
or during the endurance test, <i>i. e.</i>, the long run. The
heart is fast but regular. It comes back to its normal
beat quicker than does the heart of other men of his
weight and age.</p>

<p>The case is unusual, and I am surprised that Mr.
Fletcher can do the work of trained athletes and not give
marked evidences of over-exertion. As I am in almost
constant training I have gone over the same exercises,
and in about the same way, and have given the results
for a standard of comparison. [The figures are not
given here.]</p>

<p>My conclusion, given in condensed form, is this:
Mr. Fletcher performs this work with greater ease and
with fewer noticeable bad results than any man of his
age and condition I have ever worked with.</p>
</div>

<p>To appreciate the full significance of this
report, it must be remembered that Mr. Fletcher
had for several months past taken practically no
exercise other than that involved in daily walks
about town.</p>

<p>In view of the strenuous work imposed during
the above four days, it is quite evident that
the body had need of a certain amount of nutritive
material. Yet the work was done without
apparently drawing upon any reserve the body
may have possessed. The diet, small though it
was, and with only half the accepted requirement
in fuel value, still sufficed to furnish the
requisite energy. The work was accomplished
with perfect ease, without strain, without the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
usual resultant lameness, without taxing the
heart or lungs, and without loss of body-weight.
In other words, in Mr. Fletcher’s case
at least, the body machinery was kept in perfect
fitness without the consumption of any such
quantities of fuel as has generally been considered
necessary.</p>

<p>Just here it may be instructive to observe
that the food consumed by Mr. Fletcher during
this seven days’ period&mdash;and which has been
shown to be entirely adequate for his bodily
needs during strenuous activity&mdash;cost eleven
cents daily, thus making the total cost for the
seven days seventy-seven cents! If we contrast
this figure with the amounts generally paid for
average nourishment for a like period of time,
there is certainly food for serious thought. Mr.
Fletcher avers that he has followed his present
plan of living for nearly five years; he usually
takes two meals a day; has been led to a strong
liking for sugar and carbohydrates in general
and away from a meat diet; is always in perfect
health, and is constantly in a condition of fitness
for work. He practises thorough mastication,
with more complete insalivation of the food
(liquid as well as solid) than is usual, thereby
insuring more complete and ready digestion and
a more thorough utilisation of the nutritive portions
of the food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>In view of these results, are we not justified
in asking ourselves whether we have yet attained
a clear comprehension of the real requirements
of the body in the matter of daily nutriment?
Whether we fully comprehend the best
and most economical method of maintaining the
body in a state of physiological fitness? The
case of Mr. Fletcher, just described; the results
noted in connection with certain Asiatic peoples;
the fruitarians and <i>nut</i>arians in our own country
recently studied by Professor Jaffa, of the University
of California; all suggest the possibility
of much greater physiological economy than we
as a race are wont to practise. If these are
merely exceptional cases, we need to know it;
but if, on the other hand, it is possible for mankind
in general to maintain proper nutritive
conditions on dietary standards far below those
now accepted as necessary, it is time for us to
ascertain that fact. For, if our standards are
now unnecessarily high, then surely we are not
only practising an uneconomical method of sustaining
life, but we are subjecting ourselves to
conditions the reverse of physiological, and
which must of necessity be inimical to our well-being.
The possibility of more scientific knowledge
of the natural requirements of a healthy
nutrition is made brighter by the fact that the
economic results noted in connection with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
metabolism examination of Mr. Fletcher is confirmatory
of similar results obtained under the
direction and scrutiny of Sir Michael Foster at
the University of Cambridge, England, during
the autumn and winter of last year; and by Dr.
Ernest Van Someren, Mr. Fletcher’s <i>collaborateur</i>,
in Venice, on subjects of various ages and
of both sexes, some account of which has already
been presented to the British Medical Association
and to the International Congress of Physiologists
at its last meeting at Turin, Italy. At
the same time emphasis must be laid upon the
fact that no definite and positive conclusions
can be arrived at, except as the result of careful
experiments and observations on many individuals
covering long periods of time. This, however,
the writer hopes to do in the very near
future, with the coöperation of a corps of interested
observers.</p>

<p>The problem is far-reaching. It involves not
alone the individual, but society as a whole, for
beyond the individual lies the broader field of
the community, and what proves helpful for the
one will eventually react for the betterment of
society, and for the improvement of mankind in
general.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION_TO_DR_HARRY_CAMPBELLS">INTRODUCTION TO DR. HARRY CAMPBELL’S
CONTRIBUTION ON THE IMPORTANCE
OF MASTICATION</h3>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Since the publication of Van Someren’s paper, “Was Luigi
Cornaro Right?”, read before the British Medical Association,
and reprinted elsewhere in this volume, much more
attention has been given to the study of mastication than had
been previously reported. Mr. Gladstone’s advice to his children,
which was commonly current and was repeated whenever
mastication was mentioned, was usually accompanied and
met by an amused smile that showed that the full importance
of better mouth-treatment of food was not appreciated. <i>Glutton
or Epicure</i>, a little book by the present writer, published
in 1898, insisted on thorough use of the functions of the mouth
in alimentation but did not go into the anatomical, physiological
and dental details.</p>

<p>Dr. Harry Campbell of Northwest London Hospital has performed
this latter service to science and humanity, with splendid
carefulness, and must have devoted much time and study
to the collection of evidence and suggestion which is given
here following in full, reprinted from the <i>London Lancet</i>.</p>

<p>The authors acknowledge with much gratitude, the courteous
permission of both Dr. Campbell and of the editor of the
<i>Lancet</i>, to reprint all four articles which composed the series.</p>

<p>In our own study of the subject of mouth-treatment of food
we have been led to give more credit to the chemical feature
of preparation than Dr. Campbell yet attributes to the chemical
side of the problem. Comminution of hard food is of
first importance, undoubtedly, but insalivation and neutralisation
or alkalinisation are, seemingly, much more easily and
quickly accomplished in the mouth than farther on in the
alimentary canal. The intestines <i>can</i> do all in the way of
digestion, even if the mouth and stomach are passed and their
assistance in the digestive process is entirely neglected, but it
is done at tremendous disadvantage in the supplementary
digestive tract of the intestines. We have proven the econ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>omy
of letting the mouth do <i>all it can</i>, by the insalivation
(sipping and tasting) of liquids that have taste up to the point
of compulsory swallowing (a sucking-up by the Swallowing
Impulse which naturally occurs in the course of treatment
in the mouth if not fought against too strongly). If Dr.
Campbell will extend his observations to liquids, say milk,
and for a sufficiently long time to measure results by continued
economy of assimilation and saving of solid excreta, he
will find that it pays to let the mouth do all it can do, and that
while it <i>cannot do too much</i> it <i>may do too little</i>. The natural
instincts of the mouth, or those that attach to the mouth,
become much more discriminating also if exercised on liquids
as well as on solids. This they do not learn to do so well
if sapid liquids are habitually rushed past their field of
discrimination.</p>

<p>Taste enjoyed in the mouth is good, and a good part of the
pleasure of living comes from taste gratification, but taste that
returns from the stomach and is belched by eructation or is
lingeringly reminiscent in the mouth or nose is indicative of
indigestion.</p>

<p>Hence it is better to dissipate taste in the mouth, which is
the sole region of taste. Spirits tasted into absorption in this
way leave no odour upon the breath, and asparagus munched
and tasted to the limit in the mouth, carries no odour to the
urine. Even the stale and disagreeable odour of onion or
garlic can be neutralised by saliva and killed in the mouth.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to get observers to practise tasting
taste out of liquids as the wine tasters do, and as the tea
tasters <i>have to do or die</i>; or, at least, become useless in their
profession. Once the efficacy of the liquid-tasting precaution
in digestion is understood, however, to swallow anything but
pure water without tasting it into absorption produces a shock.
This care becomes instinctive quite easily and regulates itself
automatically. It is also a distinct gain to the gustatory possibilities,
which are very limited at best.</p>

<p>When the body will tolerate spirits tasted into it&mdash;not
poured into it&mdash;at all, which is not often when the nutrition
is normal (only in damp or cold weather, as a general thing,
and then in the case of the writer only at rare intervals, say
two or three times a year), the spirit will mix quickly with the
saliva and become neutralised sufficiently to excite the Swal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>lowing
Impulse. Continue sipping the spirit for a time and
you will note that there comes a point where the saliva and
the spirit do not mix, do not neutralise; the mouth becomes
unduly full of liquid without any relaxation or invitation of
the Swallowing Impulse; and the really instinctive inclination
will be to <i>spit it out</i>. It is a clear indication that the
body-<i>toleration</i> has been fully taxed; there is no longer any
bodily need for alcohol&mdash;in fact, there is no longer natural
toleration&mdash;and the secretion sent down into the mouth is
evidently mucous for a washing-out process, and is not alkaline
saliva for assisting in a utilisation function.</p>

<p>It is quite uncanny to observe the nicety of mouth-discrimination
and the consistency of it as related to similar substances
under similar conditions, if one learn to read it with precision
and intelligence.</p>

<p>With increased ease of digestion, which comes with more
thorough attention to solid foods alone, the ordinary observer
will think that he has accomplished the whole of the possible
benefit. It is only when he gives sufficient time to liquids
also, to get the added delight and relief that salivary respect
of them brings, that the whole of the beneficence of mouth-service
is realised. Follow this discrimination and care to a
comparative measurement of the waste of digestion, the solid
excreta, and note the increased proportionate gain in assimilation
and the value of the economy will be appreciated. Try
the different treatments on milk for a month; fifteen days
with drinking and fifteen days insalivating (sipping and tasting)
the milk to the limit, and keep account of quantity of intake
required to satisfy appetite and maintain body-weight; and
also note carefully the condition and quantity of the fæces.
In the one case you will find the waste to be <i>fæces</i> indeed, and
unmistakably worthy of the name; but in the case of sipping,
tasting and insalivating the milk to the full satisfaction of the
appetite, the <i>digestion-ash</i> will assume quite a different amount
and character and deserve a change of name. The proportions
of the saving in our own experiments have approximated
the difference between three and ten; that is, on a reduction
of only one-third the quantity of food commonly ingested,
but fully satisfying the sipping and tasting appetite, the quantity
of solid excreta was only one-tenth of the other and of
quite a different character, æsthetically considered.</p>

<p>While these suggestions do not discredit or affect the value
of the purely mechanical side of the treatment as given by Dr.
Campbell, and are not intended to be controversial, they are
ventured as an amendment to be worked out in regard to
liquids, which are, in fact, only an extreme of the pultaceous
foods against which Dr. Campbell warns us as being subtly
dangerous.</p>

<p>There is another point in our experiences and observations
of the largest importance that may appropriately be introduced
here: The treatment of all liquids in the manner suggested
prevents intemperance of drinking as effectively as it
does intemperance of eating.</p>

<p>When food is filtered into the body after having become
liquified and made alkaline, or, at least neutral, by saliva, the
appetite is given a chance to measure the needs of the body
and to discriminate against excess. As soon as the point of
complete saturation of any one deficiency is reached, the
appetite is cut off, as short as possible to imagine, with no
indication of stomach fullness. It will welcome a little of
proteid in beans, cheese, eggs, or in some other of its richer
forms, and then turn to sugar or fat in some of their numerous
forms. Thirst for water will assert itself for a moment,
sometimes asking but for a drop and again for a full glass,
and afterwards, when near the point of complete saturation,
appetite will hesitate for a moment, as if searching around
for some rare substance, and may find its final satisfaction in
a single spoonful of a sweet or a sip of something in sight.</p>

<p>The appetite satisfied by the infiltering process is a sweetly
appeased appetite, calm, rested, contented, normal. There
is no danger from the flooding of intemperance, for there is
not even toleration of excess either of more food or of more
drink, and this contented appetite will remain in the condition
of contentment until another need has really been earned by
evaporation or destructive katabolism.</p>

<p>In the teaching of this physiology and psychology of alimentation
to the children of England, lies the only true solution
of the drink question, which is now the curse of the
nation.</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell has made such a splendid case for the mechanical
side of mouth work, that it is the hope of the writer that
he will give equally careful consideration to the chemical and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
psychological sides, and in a completeness of observation
render inestimable service to his country, to science, and
humanity. A decade of trial on the inmates of an infant
orphan asylum will show the possibilities for the nation in a
single generation, if broadly applied. It might lead to an
effective intemperance, inhibition, or quarantine, and that is
all any nation needs of advantage to make it independent of
the world and truly great.—<span class="smcap">Horace Fletcher.</span>]</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Effects of Mastication</span></h4>

<p>The primary object of mastication is to
break up the food so as (1) to facilitate the
swallowing of it, and (2), still more important,
to insure its intimate admixture with the digestive
juices, not only within the mouth, but
throughout the entire digestive tract. Mastication
has, however, other important and far-reaching
effects. Thus it promotes the flow of
saliva and, when properly performed, secures a
due insalivation of the food; it increases the
quantity of alkaline saliva passing into the stomach;
it stimulates the heart and circulation;
and it finally influences the nutrition of the jaws
and their appendages by stimulating the local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
blood and lymph circulation. Now to consider
these various objects and effects of mastication.</p>

<p><i>Mastication facilitates swallowing.</i>&mdash;Many
foods cannot be swallowed without first going
through some preparation in the mouth. Soft,
moist, pultaceous foods, such as milk pudding
and porridge, can be and often, indeed, are swallowed
with little or no preliminary chewing. On
the other hand, it is a mechanical impossibility
to swallow large lumps of tough food, or very
dry food, even though, like flour, it be in a finely
divided state. Dry food needs first to be well
moistened; and it is not surprising that it promotes
a more abundant flow of saliva than moist
food, though the secretion thus excited may be
poor in ferment. Hence it follows that if we
desire to give foods which compel mastication,
they should be tough or dry. On the whole,
vegetable foods necessitate more thorough mastication
than animal. The carnivora can scarcely
be said to masticate at all the flesh which they
consume; they simply tear off portions, and
forthwith swallow them whole. Cooked flesh,
however, does require mastication, owing to the
coagulation of its proteids. The herbivora, on
the other hand, unlike the carnivora, have to
subject their food to considerable mastication
before it can be swallowed; but they generally
masticate it far more than is needful to render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
swallowing mechanically possible, as is exemplified
in the act of rumination, the object here
being to facilitate the admixture of the digestive
juices with the food.</p>

<p>According to Van Someren, if the habit of
masticating efficiently is once acquired, the food
is not swallowed before it is converted into the
liquid state, the swallowing of unmasticated
lumps being effectually prevented by a pharyngeal
reflex.</p>

<p><i>Mastication, by breaking the food up into small
particles, enables it to be brought into intimate contact
with the digestive juices.</i>&mdash;Such comminution
is especially needful in the case of raw
vegetable foods of the tougher kind, in order to
break up their cellulose framework, and to set
free the contained starch, proteids, and fats.
Foods of this kind, unless masticated, yield practically
no nutriment to the organism. I cannot
too strongly emphasise the fact that before man
learned to break up the cellulose framework of
his vegetable food by cooking he was compelled
to subject it to laborious mastication. But, while
thorough comminution is especially needed for
vegetable food when raw, it is also needed for
many cooked forms of it also,&mdash;as, for example,
solid batter pudding and new underbaked
bread, heavy lumps of which, passing into the
stomach, may seriously hamper the work of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
organ. Such substances are indigestible essentially
by virtue of their impermeability to the
digestive juices, and they gain in digestibility in
proportion as they are comminuted. The indigestibility
of new bread would appear to be
wholly due, not to any peculiarity of chemical
composition, but to its tendency to elude the
teeth and form a sodden mass impermeable to
the digestive juices, while the more powdery
stale bread is more easily broken up both in
the mouth and within the stomach. Cabbage,
again, owes its indigestibility to the fact that it
is allowed to pass into the stomach in large
masses, while the well-known digestibility of
cauliflower and minced spinach is due to the fineness
of their division; were cabbage as finely
minced as spinach usually is it would be equally
digestible.</p>

<p>Turning now to animal food it has to be remarked
that while in the raw state it may be
readily digestible with little or no previous mastication,
since massive pieces of it are readily
attacked by the digestive juices, the like is
much less true of animal food the proteids of
which have been coagulated and rendered less
permeable by cooking. Large lumps of hard-boiled
egg or overdone meat, for instance, may
obstinately resist gastric digestion; indeed, as
with vegetable so with animal foods, their rela<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>tive
digestibility depends more upon physical
consistence than chemical composition; beef is
generally more indigestible than mutton and
pork or veal than either, not so much by virtue
of chemical composition as of physical consistence;
the indigestibility of cheese illustrates
the same truth; the individual nutritive ingredients
of this substance&mdash;the proteids and fats&mdash;are
not in themselves indigestible; casein in
the form of protein or plasmon is known to be
easy of digestion, and butter is one of the most
digestible of fats; but in cheese the two are
welded together into a comparatively impermeable
mass, which is apt to escape comminution
by the teeth and to pass down into the stomach
in the form of solid lumps. A plain, wholesome
cheese well masticated or intimately mixed with
other foods, as in macaroni cheese, is quite
easily digested by the majority.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, deny the influence of
the chemical factor. Undoubtedly food may
disturb digestion by virtue of its chemical composition,
apart altogether from its physical characters;
thus, while cooked goose-fat sets up
violent irritation in some, others cannot tolerate
eggs in any shape or form, and innumerable
idiosyncrasies in respect of special articles of
diet are met with which are essentially referable
to chemical composition; but making due al<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>lowance
for this chemical influence there can, I
think, be little doubt that the digestibility of the
more common articles of diet, both animal and
vegetable, depends in the main upon their physical
constitution, <i>all of them tending to be
equally digestible when reduced to the same degree
of comminution</i>. This, if true, is, I need
scarcely say, a fact of the greatest practical importance,
for it amounts to this: that we may
often allow to those with very weak digestions
foods which are generally considered indigestible,
provided that they be thoroughly comminuted,
whether by mastication or artificial means.</p>

<p><i>Mastication promotes the flow of saliva and the
insalivation of the food.</i>&mdash;The more efficiently
food is masticated the greater is the salivary flow,
and the more intimately is it mixed with the
saliva, or, as we say, insalivated. The saliva
has apparently no effect on fats; whether it acts
on proteids seems more doubtful, though by
some authorities the penetration of these by the
alkali of this fluid is said to aid in their subsequent
digestion; on starch, however, the saliva
acts very potently, and hence mastication plays
a special part in promoting the digestion of
starchy foods. Indeed, if only mastication be
persisted in long enough, starch may be wholly
converted into maltose within the mouth, and it
need scarcely be said that it is better for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
individual himself to manufacture his maltose in
this way than that he should take it ready made
for him in the form of one of the many “malt
extracts” on the market. Patients are often
forbidden starchy food, while they are allowed
the maltose which they can quite well manufacture
in their own mouths. Provided they be
sufficiently insalivated, there are few starchy
foods which are indigestible, not even excepting
the proverbially indigestible new potato. These
remarks are especially applicable to children, as
will be more particularly insisted on later.</p>

<p><i>Mastication increases the amount of alkaline
saliva passing into the stomach</i>, and this not only
prolongs the period of starch digestion within
this organ but, by its influence upon the reaction
of the gastric contents, influences all the digestive
processes taking place there. I shall have
occasion to point out later that a deficient supply
of alkaline saliva in the stomach predisposes to
certain forms of indigestion.</p>

<p><i>Mastication acts reflexly upon the stomach.</i>&mdash;It
is now known that the act of mastication
influences the stomach reflexly, promoting the
flow of gastric juice and thus preparing the stomach
for the entrance of food into it. If the
œsophagus of a dog is cut so as to allow the
swallowed food to escape instead of passing into
the stomach, it is found that the mastication of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
food causes a considerable flow of gastric juice.
Food introduced into the stomach unaccompanied
by mastication is less effective in promoting
the gastric flow. It is probable that the
influence of mastication on the flow of gastric
juice is largely produced through the medium
of psychic influences, for the more efficient
the mastication the more is the sense of taste
affected.</p>

<p><i>Mastication stimulates the heart and so promotes
the general circulation.</i>&mdash;This stimulating
action may be partly due to its local action on
the flow of blood and lymph in the jaws and
accessory parts, and partly to a reflex influence,
but whatever the explanation there can be no
doubt of the fact. Hence the mere chewing of
a non-nutritive substance, such as gum arabic,
is stimulating, and, doubtless, the stimulating
effects induced by the chewing of such articles
as tobacco and betel are largely to be explained
in this way.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Influence of Mastication on the
Jaws and Adjacent Structures</span></h4>

<p>This subject is of such importance that it
needs to be dealt with in some detail. By
“adjacent structures” I mean the masticatory
muscles, tongue, teeth, salivary glands, the nasal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
passages and sinuses pertaining thereto, the
naso-pharynx, soft palate, and tonsils.</p>

<p><i>The muscles of mastication.</i>&mdash;Let me at
the outset draw attention to certain anatomical
points, in connection with the muscles of mastication.
These are (<i>a</i>) their massiveness; (<i>b</i>)
the very close relation of the pterygoids to the
naso-pharynx; and (<i>c</i>) the outward direction of
the pterygoids.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It is not until one studies the muscles
of mastication closely that one comes to realise
their massiveness. Their large size, in relation
to the bony structures in connection with them,
is well shown in a vertical transverse section of
the head carried through the ascending ramus
of the mandible<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (see Fig. 1). It is evident
that the functional activity of so large a mass
of muscle tissue cannot but exercise considerable
influence on the nutrition of the neighbouring
parts.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus-143" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/illus-143.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;Vertical transverse (slightly oblique) section through
the head on a level with the epiglottis. The massiveness of the
system of masticatory muscles is apparent.</div>
</div>


<p>(<i>b</i>) The pterygoid muscles, springing as
they do from the internal pterygoid plates, must
necessarily be in close relation with the naso-pharynx,
especially the internal pair, which
take their origin from the internal aspect of the
internal plates. I would further point out that
the external pair, although they diverge from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the naso-pharynx on their way to the mandibular
condyles, yet remain on a level with that
cavity. This close relation of the pterygoids
to the naso-pharynx is, if I mistake not, of
great importance in relation to the etiology
of “adenoids.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Of the two pairs of pterygoids the external
pair pass in the more outward direction,
forming with the sagittal plane of the head
an angle of 45° (see Figs. 1 and 2). In consequence
of this direction they tend by their
contraction to pull the pterygoid plates and
posterior parts of the maxilla away from the
sagittal plane of the head, and thus to secure
the normal width of the posterior nares. It
is these muscles which bring about the lateral
movements of the mandible, causing the lower
teeth to move laterally and sagittally across the
upper, the food being in this way far more effectually
ground than by a mere vertical pressure
of the teeth against one another. These
lateral movements are, as we shall see, less
pronounced among the moderns than among
primitive peoples.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Portion of horizontal section of head about an inch
below the condyles of the lower jaw. The outward direction of
the external pterygoids is well shown; also the close relation of
the levatores and tensores palati with the internal pterygoids.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The influence of the contraction of the masticatory
muscles on the local circulation of blood and
lymph.</i>&mdash;When a muscle is at rest the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
flows sluggishly through it, while there is a complete,
or all but complete, stagnation of the lymph
current; if a lymphatic trunk of a limb at rest
be cut no lymph escapes from it. Rhythmic
muscle contractions, however, stimulate the flow
both of blood and lymph (<i>a</i>), in the contracting
muscles themselves and (<i>b</i>) in the neighbouring
parts. (<i>a</i>) Not only are the muscle arteries
dilated during rhythmic contractions, but the
blood is vigorously squirted out of the muscle
veins, so that much more blood flows through
a muscle during its rhythmic contraction than
during rest. The flow of lymph is even more
markedly stimulated,&mdash;this fluid, which, while the
muscle is at rest, is stagnant or all but so, being
during contraction driven actively along the
lymphatic trunks. (<i>b</i>) How greatly rhythmic
muscle contractions influence the circulation of
fluids in the neighbouring parts is shown by the
flushing of the skin and the swelling of the soft
parts generally of a limb which is being exercised.
We thus see how profoundly the exercise
of the masticatory muscles&mdash;and among
these we must not forget to include the tongue&mdash;influences
not only their own nutrition but
that of the important structures adjacent to
them&mdash;that is to say, of the jaw-bones, salivary
glands, buccal mucous membrane, soft palate,
faucial tonsils, pharynx, and naso-pharynx, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
well as of the nasal cavities and their accessory
sinuses. All these parts are during mastication
copiously flushed with blood and lymph, from
which it is evident that efficient mastication
must stimulate their nutrition and favour their
proper development. Hence, in one who has
from childhood upwards been accustomed to
masticate efficiently, we generally find these parts
well developed, the jaws large and shapely, the
teeth regular and straight, the tongue and salivary
glands large, the nasal and naso-pharyngeal
passages spacious, and the mucous membrane
of the buccal and adjoining cavities healthy.</p>

<p><i>Influence of mastication on the jaw-bones.</i>&mdash;It
is well known that the size of a bone is largely
determined by the degree to which the muscles
attached to it are exercised. That the jaws do
not grow to their normal size, if not adequately
exercised during their period of growth, is strikingly
shown by the overcrowding of the teeth,
which takes place in those brought up on soft
foods, and this even though there be no contraction
of the jaws resulting from mouth-breathing.
The dependence of the size of the jaws upon
the degree to which they are exercised is also
shown by the smallness of the modern jaw, as
compared with that of primitive peoples, a difference
which, as we shall see, is in part congenital
and in part due to the comparative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
disuse of the former. Mastication influences not
only the size but also the shape of the jaws (<i>a</i>),
through its influence on the size of the tongue,
which by pressing against the teeth tends, as
Sim Wallace has shown, to expand the jaws;
(<i>b</i>) by the pressure of opposing teeth against
one another, which has a similar effect; and
(<i>c</i>) by the outward pull of the pterygoids, which
tends to widen the maxilla posteriorly and to
broaden the posterior nares.</p>

<p><i>Influence of mastication on the teeth.</i>&mdash;The
teeth being developed within the jaw-bones and
remaining, even after eruption, in close anatomical
and physiological association with them,
must necessarily share in their nutritive tendencies.
If these bones are efficiently exercised
during the formation of the teeth&mdash;and my remarks
apply especially to the permanent set&mdash;the
tooth-germs will be abundantly flushed with
blood, while the ample growth of the jaws themselves
will provide the germs with plenty of room
in which to grow and to develop, and the more
perfect their growth and development the more
resistant should we expect them to be to the
ravages of caries. Who can contemplate the
jaw-bones of a six-years-old child, dissected so
as to display all the imbedded teeth, without
being assured of the effect of mastication upon
dental development? Fifty-two teeth meet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
view: the whole region from the orbital rims to
the inferior border of the mandible is literally
paved with them, and I can hardly doubt that
they collectively weigh more than the bone in
which they are imbedded. Surely no one can
examine such a dissection without being convinced
of the urgent necessity, if the teeth are
to grow and to develop normally, of giving the
child’s jaws from infancy onwards plenty of
work to do.</p>

<p>The ample development of the jaws, which
efficient mastication brings about, has a further
beneficial effect as regards the teeth, in that it
enables them to take up their proper places in
the alveolar ridges, thus securing all the advantages
of a good “bite.” These I now proceed
to consider. The teeth during mastication, and
especially when the bite is good and the food
of a kind necessitating vigorous and sustained
mastication, are made to move in their sockets
both vertically and horizontally; the effect of
this is to stimulate the circulation in the tooth-pulp,
the alveolar periosteum (and hence also
in the cementum and alveolar walls which are
supplied by it), and the circumjacent mucous
membrane of the gum. All this makes for the
health of the teeth; not only does it promote
the nutrition of the tooth itself and of its bony
socket, thus maintaining a firm dental setting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
but it also tends to secure a healthy environment
for the exposed part of the tooth&mdash;that
part, namely, wherein caries begins&mdash;by maintaining
a healthy state of the surrounding and,
indeed, of the entire buccal mucous membrane,
as well as of the various secretions which bathe
the mouth. Wherefore it is not surprising to
find that those who masticate efficiently suffer
much less from dental caries and its complications
(such as abscess at the root) and disease
of the periodontal membrane (<i>e.g.</i>, pyorrhœa
alveolaris and loosening of the teeth) than those
who are accustomed to bolt their food.</p>

<p>A few words as to the influence of mastication
in wearing down the teeth. In those races
which masticate vigorously the teeth in quite
early adult life show signs of wearing away,
while in later life it is quite common for the
biting surfaces to be worn flat; sometimes the
crown of the molars is worn away so that its
surface shelves downwards and inwards and not
infrequently it is concave, having a scooped-out
appearance; often the dentine is exposed in
this way; and yet among many hundreds of
skulls examined I do not remember to have
seen one single case where caries has started
on the biting surface thus worn down.</p>

<p>I had always attributed this wearing down of
the teeth to the friction of coarse food against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
them. Primitive races eat coarse vegetable food,
which frequently contains grit, and this doubtless
helps to grind the teeth down, but they
may be markedly ground down even in those
living on soft food, and in such cases the grinding
away can obviously only be due to the friction
of opposing teeth against one another. I,
indeed, believe this to be the essential cause of
the phenomenon, both in civilised races living
on soft food and in primitive races whose coarse
food necessitates prolonged and vigorous mastication
and a corresponding amount of attrition
between the biting surfaces of opposing teeth.
In order that this attrition may occur two things
are requisite: the upper and lower teeth must
be well opposed&mdash;there must be a good bite&mdash;and
mastication must be vigorous and of the
right kind. Mere vertical pressure of the teeth
against one another will not wear away the opposing
surfaces; there must be friction of these
surfaces against one another&mdash;a transverse and
sagittal movement of the lower teeth against the
upper by means of the pterygoids. Mainly to
this do I attribute the marked wearing down of
the teeth observed in primitive peoples, and I
am gratified to know that so competent an
authority on dental pathology as Sim Wallace
is a convert to this view.</p>

<p>That all the teeth may be worn down just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
we observe in primitive people, even in those
who have lived all their lives on the ordinary
fare of the moderns, is proved by a case I have
under observation. It is that of a man in his
fiftieth year, who was brought up in Belgium
but who has resided in London for the last
thirty years. When he came to my out-patient
room I was not a little surprised to find that all
his teeth were sound&mdash;a very unusual occurrence,
I need hardly say, among the London
poor at his age. In seeking for an explanation
I elicited the fact that he was unable to swallow
his food without chewing it very thoroughly,
and on giving him a moderate-sized piece of
bread, with the request that he should chew it
in the ordinary way, I found that he subjected
it to one hundred and twenty separate bites before
swallowing it, and in the steady, deliberate
way he went to work and in his extensive lateral
movements of the mandible he reminded one
for all the world of a cow chewing its cud. The
temporals and masseters of this man are enormous,
and the like is no doubt true of the pterygoids;
he has well-developed nasal passages, has
never suffered from nasal obstruction, while his
buccal mucous membrane is unusually healthy
for one of his years and circumstances. May
we not attribute this healthy state of the mouth,
teeth, and nose to the good effects upon them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
of efficient chewing? Here is a man who has
lived for thirty years in London on the same
kind of food as the average poor Londoner, but
instead of finding his mouth full of carious, tartar-coated
teeth, and spongy, receding, pus-exuding
gums, we find thirty-two sound teeth
firmly set in healthy gums and all but devoid
of tartar.</p>

<p>A word as to the wearing down of the teeth
in the anthropoid apes. In this respect the
gorilla differs markedly from the orang and the
chimpanzee. In all the skulls of these latter
which I have examined the teeth show signs of
wearing away, while I have found the teeth of
the gorilla, with the exception of the tusk-like
canines, but little worn. From this we should
expect the latter animal to be mainly carnivorous,
and the orang and chimpanzee to be largely
herbivorous.</p>

<p>1. <i>The anthropoid stage.</i>&mdash;The diet of man’s
anthropoid ancestors was probably much the
same as is that of existing anthropoid apes; it
consisted, namely, of raw vegetable and animal
food, necessitating a vigorous use of the maxillary
apparatus. This latter, we may assume,
was of the type belonging to the anthropoids&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
the jaws were massive and markedly prognathic;
the denture was the same as it is in existing
man, but the teeth were larger, especially
the upper canines, which served as weapons of
offence and defence; the third molars (the wisdom
teeth) were as large as the other molars
and were provided with three fangs, and there
was an ample portion of alveolar ridge behind
them; there was no chin. No doubt the massiveness
and the marked prognathism, which
characterised the jaws at this stage, served other
ends than that of mastication; it is obvious that
projecting jaws and teeth are much more effec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>tual
for seizing and lacerating prey than are the
orthognathic jaws of modern man.</p>

<p>2. <i>The pre-cooking human stage</i> extends from
the time man’s ancestors first assumed the human
form till they learned to apply fire in the
preparation of their food. During all this period
the jaws and teeth were probably used as much,
or almost as much, for mastication as during the
anthropoid stage; raw animal food had to be torn
from the bones, the latter had to be crunched,
while the bulk of the raw vegetable food needed
then no less than it needs now prolonged and
vigorous mastication in order to liberate the
starch and other nutritive ingredients from their
undigestible cellulose envelopes.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Nevertheless,
the jaws and teeth underwent considerable
change during this period, for not only were
they with every advance in intelligence called
less and less into requisition for purposes of
offence and defence, but the jaws, at least,
became materially modified in correlation with
the expanding cranial cavity and in connection
with the assumption of the erect posture. It is,
I think, rather for these reasons than in consequence
of alterations in the nature of the food
that the masticatory apparatus now gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
lost its more bestial aspect and assumed an
essentially human type, becoming towards the
close of the period much the same as may
be observed among the most primitive peoples
now living.</p>

<p>3. <i>The pre-agricultural cooking period.</i>&mdash;The
characters of the maxillary apparatus belonging
to this period are still available for study, the
aboriginal Australians, the Bushmen, Negritos,
and many Esquimaux not having yet emerged
from it. So far as mastication is concerned,
cooking influences vegetable far more than
animal food, for it not only softens it but by
rupturing the undigestible cellulose chambers
and liberating their contents relieves mastication
of one of its essential functions. Wherefore,
with the advent of cooking, man’s jaws and teeth
began to get smaller, and they have continued
to diminish in size up to the present time. No
great diminution, however, took place at first,
inasmuch as the diet still continued to be largely
animal (and prior to the use of knives and forks
such food had to be torn by the teeth), while
the coarse vegetable food of this date, even
when cooked, still needed laborious mastication.
The chief differences between the maxillary apparatus
of this early cooking age as compared
with that of the present day are as follows: the
jaws of the earlier period&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, in the abo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>riginal
Australian&mdash;are more massive, and their
sagittal diameter is greater, giving rise to decided
prognathism, the teeth for the most part
are larger and stronger, the third molars being
nearly, if not quite, as big as the other molars,
and provided with three fangs, while there is
a considerable portion of alveolar ridge behind
them. The third molars, however, show a decided
tendency to be smaller than the rest, and
the alveolar ridge behind them is less marked
than in the previous period, features, I doubt
not, attributable to the influence of cooking in
diminishing mastication. Dental caries is rare
and is chiefly met with in the third molars.</p>

<p>4. <i>The early agricultural age.</i>&mdash;All the existing
primitive races which have attained to the
cultivation of the soil may be regarded as belonging
to this period. Previously to it man
was mainly carnivorous, owing to the comparatively
limited quantity of vegetable food available,
so long as the supply was left to nature
alone; but when by cultivation this supply was
increased and, at the same time, rendered more
constant and certain, he gradually became less
carnivorous and more vegetarian in his diet.
The result of agriculture, however, is not only
to increase the supply of vegetable food, but to
diminish its fibrous, cellulosic ingredients, and
thus to render it more easily masticated. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
at this stage we find the maxillary apparatus
becoming smaller than in the previous period,
although the difference as shown&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, by the
examinations of the skulls of the African negroes
and the Melanesians&mdash;is less pronounced than
we might perhaps have anticipated; prognathism
is not so decided, the jaws are smaller, also the
teeth, especially the third molars, which now
for the first time show a tendency to be furnished
with two instead of three fangs, while
the alveolar ridge behind them is distinctly
shorter than in the preceding period. Dental caries,
hitherto rare, now becomes more frequent.</p>

<p>5. <i>The late agricultural period.</i>&mdash;A mid-agricultural
period might be described, but I shall
take no account of it here, but pass on to a consideration
of the late agricultural period&mdash;that,
namely, in which we ourselves live. The chief
characteristic of the food of this period is its
softness. Cooked animal food requires, indeed,
more mastication than raw, but the vegetable
food of to-day, owing to the combined effects of
improved agriculture, and skilful milling and
cooking, is so soft as to excite comparatively
little mastication. The present may, in fact, be
described as the <i>age of pap</i>. Hence the jaws
and teeth are now called upon to perform far
less work than in any earlier stage of our evolution,
and there has taken place in consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
a great diminution in their size, more especially
in the size of the jaws, so that there is now often
no room for the teeth to take up their normal
positions, and there is generally a complete absence
of alveolar ridge behind the last molars.
The latter are, moreover, apt to be very small
or even absent, while dental caries is alarmingly
frequent.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that from the period of
the anthropoids to the present time, a progressive
change in the size and shape of the jaws and
teeth has been taking place, a change which is
to be explained by (1) the cessation of the need
for using them for offensive and defensive purposes;
(2) the growing capacity of the cranium
and the assumption of the erect position; (3)
the progressive alteration in man’s diet; and
probably also (4) considerations of beauty.
The first three factors have operated through
natural selection, the last through sexual selection,
which has come into play, I would suggest,
chiefly within recent times. Probably the
most pronounced change which has taken place
in the jaws during the agricultural periods has
been the suppression of prognathism which, in
the woman especially, is very unsightly, and
tends to diminish the likelihood of marriage.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Instances of the Vigorous Use to which
the Jaws and Teeth are put among
Existing Primitive Peoples</span></h4>

<p>A study of existing primitive peoples brings
forcibly home to the mind how laboriously the
jaws and teeth of our primitive ancestors were
used. I have already shown how in pre-agricultural
and early agricultural times the nature
of the food compelled a sustained and vigorous
exercise of these structures, and I wish here
only to refer to a few specific and peculiar instances
of laborious mastication exercised by
primitive races now or recently living.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Among
some of these mastication has been promoted
almost to the position of an industrial art.</p>

<p><i>The chewing of very tough substances in order
to extract therefrom liquid or nourishment.</i>&mdash;The
recently extinct Tasmanians included among
their articles of diet a species of sea-weed which,
even when cooked, was so tough as to require
long-sustained mastication in order to extract
its nutrient elements. The Indians of North
California chew kelp, which is “as tough as
white leather” (<i>i. e.</i>, leather dressed with alum).
“A young fellow with good teeth will masticate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
a piece of it a whole day.” Again Featherman<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
tells how when the Bushmen are short of food
in the winter they steep an old dried gnu-skin in
water and, having rubbed off the hair, boil it,
and proceed to gnaw the tough morsel until
their very jaws ache. The Modoc Indians are
said to munch the raw kais root all day long.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Among the Esquimaux it is a universal custom
to chew the raw skin of the whale, the porpoise,
and the seal for the blubber it contains, and the
skin being as tough as india-rubber, it requires,
as may be imagined, a good deal of chewing.
The Lower Californians also chew deer-skin and
ox-skin (Bayert). The more southern Esquimaux,
according to Nansen, preserve the stalks of
<i>angelica</i> by steeping them in a mixture of chewed
blubber and saliva. Finally, I may refer to the
habit of chewing the sugar-cane, a practice
which is prevalent among the natives in all
countries where the cane grows, and affords, it
need scarcely be said, abundant exercise for
the jaws and teeth.</p>

<p><i>Mastication in the preparation of beverages.</i>&mdash;I
find that among widely separated aboriginal
peoples chewing is resorted to in the preparation
of beverages, both intoxicating and non-intoxicating.
The Gran Chaco Indians make an in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>toxicating
drink by chewing the algarroba bean
and then spitting into a receptacle. In other
parts of South America berries are chewed with
the same object. In some of the Pacific Islands
boys and girls with good teeth are selected to
chew a root (kava), from which they then prepare
a drink. In New Guinea drinks are similarly
prepared from roots. Boiled cassava root
is chewed by the Indians of Nicaragua for the
same purpose. In British Guiana the natives
make a drink by adding chewed maize and
saliva to sweet potato, maize, and sugar-cane.
The Indians in Honduras, after steeping cassava
cake or carbonised bread in hot water, chew a
portion and mix it with the rest.</p>

<p><i>Mastication in the industries.</i>&mdash;Even among
moderns teeth are used for many purposes
other than mastication&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, for holding pins
and needles and for severing cotton; also in some
industries&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, among diamond workers&mdash;where
it is the custom for girls to hold the
diamond between their front teeth, which in
consequence get much worn away, as I have
myself seen. It is only among primitive peoples,
however, that the jaws and teeth actually play
the part of implements for use in the arts. The
Australian women make lines, nets, and bags
by chewing various kinds of fibre, a process
which wears down their teeth considerably and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
may cause them to be tender.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The Esquimaux
are still more dependent upon the use of
their teeth as implements, especially in the
preparation of skins for their clothing, boats,
and lines. The teeth are used to hold the skins,
while the latter are being scraped, the mouth
constituting, in fact, “a third hand;” and the
front teeth of Esquimaux women are often by
this means worn away to the merest stumps.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The garments of the Esquimaux, even to the
boots, are made up of skins which have been
laboriously chewed for this purpose by the
women “inch by inch,” till they acquire a beautiful
softness and flexibility, and are often, indeed,
chewed again after having been dried.
And we are told that the women have no objection
to the task, while the children are eager to
help in it on account of the blubber the skin
contains; also, that in bad times the men do not
object to join in the work. The lines for harpooning
are prepared in a similar way from
the skin of the bearded seal, and in very large
quantities.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When we think of the quantity of
skins needed for these lines, for their dress,
including boots and gloves, and for their boats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
(although for the latter some skins are used
without having first undergone chewing), it is
clear that enormous quantities must be chewed.
The Esquimaux men also use their teeth considerably
in other work&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, in lashing the
sledges together.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Indians of North California
use their teeth for stripping the bark
from the fresh shoots employed in making their
wickerwork utensils, and they also employ their
teeth in making strings, cords, and nets.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Instinct to Masticate</span></h4>

<p>Seeing that the maxillary apparatus of man
has for long ages past been put to vigorous use,
it is not surprising that the need to exercise it
should express itself as a powerful instinct.
This instinct manifests itself in many and curious
ways, some of which I will now consider. During
the early months of life the natural function
of feeding at the breast provides the infant’s
jaws, tongue, and lips with all the needful exercise.
This bottle-feeding fails to do, and we
frequently find bottle-fed children seeking to
satisfy the natural instinct by sucking their
thumb, fingers, or any convenient object to
hand. The teeth are a provision for biting hard
foods, but even before they actually appear we
find the child seeking to exercise his toothless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
gums on any hard substance he can lay hold of,
and there can be no doubt that exercise of this
kind tends to facilitate the eruption of the teeth,
a truth, indeed, recognised universally, whether
by the primitive mother who strings the tooth
of some wild animal round the neck of her infant,
or the up-to-date parent who provides her
child with a bejewelled ivory or coral bauble.
When the teeth have erupted, the masticatory
instinct finds among primitive peoples abundant
satisfaction in the chewing of the coarse, hard
foods which constitute their dietary; but among
us moderns, subsisting as we do mainly on soft
foods, affording but little exercise for the masticatory
apparatus, it does not find its proper
expression, and thus tends to die out. Nevertheless,
it dies a hard death, and long continues
to assert itself; witness the tendency of children
to bite their pencils and pen-holders; I
have known a child to gnaw through a bone
pen-holder, much in the same way as a carnivorous
animal gnaws at a bone.</p>

<p>This instinct to chew for chewing’s sake manifests
itself all over the world. In our own
country not only do children bite pencils and
pen-holders, but they will chew small pieces of
india-rubber for hours together. The practice
of gum-chewing, so common among our American
cousins, evidently comes down from far-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
times, for the primitive Australians chew several
kinds of gum, attributing to them nutrient qualities,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and the Patagonians are said to keep
their teeth white and clean by chewing <i>matri</i>, a
gum which exudes from the incense bush, and
is carefully collected by the women and children.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A widespread custom in the East is betel-chewing,
which is met with in India, Malay,
Melanesia, and Polynesia, and even among the
primitive Veddahs of Ceylon. This article is
composed of the pungent leaf of the betel plant,
the areca nut and lime rolled together, and
when chewed yields a reddish juice which stains
the mouth and teeth. The Veddahs, failing
to get the genuine article, manufacture a quid
from the leaves of an aromatic plant, the barks
of one or two kinds of tree, and calcined small
shells.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The compound must possess some
strange attraction, for otherwise such pains would
not be taken to secure it. What is the attraction?
Doubtless betel has stimulating properties,
and it must, moreover, be remembered
that the mere mechanical act of mastication
stimulates the circulation, a fact which helps to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
explain the tendency for man, all the world over,
to chew non-nutrient substances. Tobacco-chewing
is common in many parts of the world,
and here, again, the effect for the time is stimulating.
Pitcherie is extensively chewed among
the aboriginal Australians; it consists of twigs
of about the thickness of rye-grass stems, which
are first chewed into a mass, then mixed with
the ash of gum trees, and made into a paste,
which is chewed for its stimulating and narcotic
effects.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>I may allude in passing to the grinding of the
teeth, which takes place during sleep in disturbed
states of the nervous system. It is a
true masticatory act, in which the normal lateral
movement of the mandible is well marked, and
it may thus be regarded as a perverted manifestation
of the masticatory instinct.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Causation of Inefficient Mastication</span></h4>

<p>The effects for good upon the organism of
efficient mastication being profound and far-reaching,
it follows that inefficient mastication
must lead to many evils. What these are we
have now to consider; but first it will be well
to inquire into the causes of the defective mastication
which prevails among moderns.</p>

<p>1. <i>Softness of food.</i>&mdash;By far the most impor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>tant
of these lies in the nature of the food taken.
The food of to-day&mdash;of the late agricultural
age period, as I have termed it&mdash;is for the
most part soft and pappy, of a kind which does
not compel thorough mastication; so much so,
indeed, that, as I have already said, we may
speak of this as the age of pap. This feature is
especially noticeable in the case of children’s
diet: under the modern system children are kept
on a liquid, or semi-liquid, diet, not merely during
the first months, but during the first years
of life, and at the seventh or eighth month all
kinds of artificial saccharide foods in liquid or
semi-liquid form are poured into the child’s
stomach; thereafter he is fed on such viands as
mashed potatoes and gravy, rusks soaked in
milk, milk puddings, bread dipped in bacon fat,
pounded mutton, thin bread-and-butter, and the
like; and we are told that this is the kind of
diet best suited to the young human, from the
time of weaning to the end of the second year!
The same pernicious methods are adopted subsequently.
“Perhaps the great majority of children
after they have got their complete set of
temporary teeth have,” writes Dr. Sim Wallace,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
“a dietary such as the following. Breakfast:
bread-and-milk or porridge, milk, tea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
coffee, or cocoa, bread-and-butter, perhaps an
egg. Dinner: potatoes and gravy, or meat,
milk pudding. Tea: milk or tea with bread-and-butter,
jam, cakes. Supper: bread or biscuit
and milk.” Now food of this kind does not
invite mastication, and it finds its way into the
stomach all too readily. Hence the instinct to
masticate has little opportunity of exercise and,
not being properly exercised, tends, as I have
said, to die out. Small wonder that the child
nourished on such pappy food acquires the habit
of bolting it, and learns to reject hard, coarse
foods in favour of the softer kinds; everything
nowadays must be tender, pultaceous, or “short.”
Given a choice between a food compelling little or
no mastication and one necessitating prolonged
mastication&mdash;as between, say, fresh Vienna
bread and an Abernethy biscuit&mdash;and in nineteen
cases out of twenty the one which gives
the least trouble in eating will be chosen. To
such absurd lengths has this harmful custom
been pushed that even bread crust is avoided
by many. Witness the fashion of eating bread-and-butter
with a minimum of crust; order
bread-and-butter at any place of refreshment,
and the last thing you will be served with is a
plateful of crusts of bread. Many establishments,
indeed, make a regular practice of giving
away their crusts as unsaleable. Thus, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
rectangular loaves used for bread-and-butter in
the “Aërated bread-shops” are cut transversely
into slices, each loaf thus yielding two end
crusts which are put into baskets for the poor,
only the soft crumby pieces being reserved for
the customers, to be, in due course, no doubt
washed down by copious libations of tea and
coffee.</p>

<p>When we trace the diet of the modern from
childhood upwards we find the same story:
it tends to remain soft and pappy to the end.
Animal food, especially as it comes to the tables
of the well-to-do, necessitates very little mastication.
It is the coarser varieties of vegetable
food alone which call out the full functional activity
of the masticatory apparatus, but the vegetable
food of to-day is rarely of a kind to do
this; cooked vegetables, such as potatoes,
greens, peas, and beans, can be, and generally
are, swallowed after little or no preliminary
mastication, and our flour is so carefully deprived
of its fibrous portions and so cunningly
dealt with in the bakehouse and kitchen in the
making of bread, cakes, and pastry which shall
eat light and short that these articles get very
little chewing; while such vegetable products
as rice, vermicelli, tapioca, and macaroni are, as
served at table, so soft that they slip down into
the stomach almost as readily as simple milk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Let any one run through his dietary of any one
day, and he will realise how very little work his
masticatory apparatus is called upon to perform.
It will read something like the following.
Breakfast: porridge and milk, eggs, bacon,
bread, and marmalade. Lunch: fish, tender
meat, boiled vegetables, bread, some “sweet,”
and cheese. Tea: bread, butter, and cake.
Dinner: much the same as lunch. What opportunity,
I ask, does such a bill-of-fare afford
for the development of teeth and jaws, and for
the proper functional activity of the salivary
glands?</p>

<p>2. <i>Defective masticatory apparatus.</i>&mdash;Another
potent cause of inefficient mastication is some
defect in the masticatory apparatus, and defects
of this kind are very common in those who
have not been accustomed to masticate thoroughly
in early life. Foremost among these are
irregularities of the teeth leading to faulty
“bite” and caries of the teeth which causes
them to be tender or to break away, if it does
not lead to their actual extraction. Mastication
cannot be thorough where the bite is defective,
for this not only leads to imperfect opposition
of the upper and lower teeth, but renders the
lower ones incapable of that ample lateral
movement, against the upper which is needful
to normal mastication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>3. <i>Idiosyncrasy.</i>&mdash;Some are temperamentally
more disposed to hurry over their meals than
others. The katabolic, restless, nervous individual
is more apt to swallow his food hastily
than is his more deliberate and phlegmatic
brother. Individual differences in this respect
are even observed among the lower animals.
Thus, one of a pair of horses of about
the same age and build is nervous and excitable
and inclined to bolt its food, while its companion
of more stolid temperament is a thorough and
efficient masticator. The former shows comparatively
little wearing down of the teeth, and
often suffers from indigestion, a large portion of
corn grains passing through his digestive canal
intact; in the latter the teeth are well worn,
indigestion never occurs, and but very few
grains pass through the digestive tract unchanged.
It may be objected here that we cannot
help temperament, and to a large extent
this is true; but much can be done towards
modifying it, and it is something to know where
dangers, temperamental dangers, among others,
lie.</p>

<p>4. <i>Circumstances of life.</i>&mdash;Again, in this
hurrying, strenuous age people are much less
deliberate than in the easy, slow-going days of
long ago. A meal is too often regarded as
something to be got through quickly, as taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
up time which might be devoted to something
more profitable. Especially is this true of
breakfast and lunch; it is no uncommon thing
for a business man to hurry through his breakfast
in a few minutes, preparatory to rushing off
to his train, and his lunch as likely as not is
as hastily swallowed in his office or at a bar.
Tradesmen are apt to take their meals in mere
snatches; apprentices, shop girls, and other
“hands” are often not allowed sufficient time
for their meals; while, to come to the professions,
we all know how the busy medical
man, for instance, is often obliged to take a
hurried snack in the short intervals between
seeing his patients. No wonder that thus circumstanced
people acquire the habit of bolting
their food. A meal should be regarded as an
end, and an important end, in itself. It should
be taken at leisure, body and mind being, for
the time being, given up to it, and to agreeable
social intercourse. If this rule were always observed
a most important source of inefficient
mastication would be removed.</p>


<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">Section III.</span> From <i>London Lancet</i>, July 25, 1903</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Evils resulting from Inefficient
Mastication</span></h4>

<p><i>Too much food is eaten.</i>&mdash;Inefficient mastication
conduces to excessive eating. Now it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
obvious that soft foods, and these constitute the
bulk of our modern dietary, pass much more
readily into the stomach than coarse, hard foods
which compel a certain amount of preliminary
mastication, and for this reason the former predispose
to excessive eating: hence a danger at
all periods of life, not only in grown-ups but in
children, even infants; brought up as the latter
are, mainly on liquid and pappy foods, many of
them consume not only far more than is needful,
but far more than is healthful, their stomachs
being literally deluged with nutriment.</p>

<p>When the food is of a kind necessitating
abundant mastication it is much less likely to be
taken in excess, for the longer the time spent in
mastication the less will the individual be tempted
to consume; even in the case of soft food, less
will probably be eaten if it be thoroughly masticated
and insalivated than if it be bolted.
Thorough mastication, however, not only tends
to diminish the amount of food consumed on
account of the time and labour which it entails;
it actually reduces the amount needful to constitute
a sufficiency, for the more perfectly the
food is chewed the more perfectly is it digested
and the more economically is it disposed of
in the system; the less, moreover, is the tendency
to that morbid craving for food which
is so frequent an accompaniment of defective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
digestion. It is certain that appetite and the
needs of the system are sooner satisfied when
food is well masticated and digested than when
it is swallowed whole.</p>

<p><i>A mass of unmasticated food may lodge in the
throat and cause fatal suffocation.</i>&mdash;This may
seem to be a very exceptional kind of evil, but
I am informed by one whose experience makes
him an authority on the ways of the British
soldier that it is by no means uncommon for
soldiers in barracks to die from this cause.
Usually it is when they are under the influence
of alcohol that fatal results occur, post-mortem
examination disclosing large undigested masses
of food in the stomach. A like experience is
also frequently met with in the case of men
killed by accident.</p>

<p><i>The presence of masses of imperfectly masticated
food in the stomach may cause disturbance
either mechanically or by reason of their imperviousness
to the gastric juices.</i>&mdash;We have already
seen that the digestibility of a food is largely
determined by its consistence, and that many
articles of diet, such as cheese, hard-boiled egg,
cocoa-nut, lobster, and new bread, which have
the reputation of being very indigestible, can, if
finely comminuted by chewing or otherwise, be
rendered quite digestible. Such articles are indigestible
essentially by reason of their compact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>ness;
the compact lumps, but little pervious to
the gastric juice, tend to undergo abnormal chemical
change in the stomach, and may in this way
cause violent local irritation, even to the extent of
setting up acute gastritis; or they may paralyse
the nerves of the stomach and check gastric
secretion and movement, and thus remain <i>in loco</i>
wholly undigested for hours or even days; or,
again, more distant nervous effects may be produced,
such as frontal headache, which may be
felt almost immediately after ingestion of the
peccant substance, being of reflex rather than
toxic origin, and presumably in some cases, at
least, due to the mere mechanical irritation of
the stomach. The passage of imperfectly
digested food into the bowel may still further
aggravate matters. It does not seem improbable
that the habitual bolting of food, by the
prolonged local irritation to which it gives rise,
may predispose to cancer of the stomach:
Napoleon was a notorious fast eater and it is
well known that he died from this disease.</p>

<p>While, however, the bolting of food readily
sets up disturbance in some, it must be conceded
that in many it seems to cause little or no
inconvenience; especially is this the case in the
young with vigorous muscular stomachs capable
of triturating the food, and thus doing duty for
the teeth. The human stomach is, indeed, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
long-suffering organ, and wonderfully tolerant of
ill-treatment, sometimes almost rivalling in its
hardiness the gizzard of the bird. Nor is this
surprising when we reflect that it is, in the
ordinary course of nature, constantly exposed
to the entrance of noxious substances. In this
respect it stands in marked contrast to the
intestines, for not only are highly irritant substances
often vomited rather than passed onwards,
but in ordinary circumstances the gastric
contents are not allowed to pass the pylorus, until
they have been duly prepared by the stomach;
the pylorus, in fact, stands guard over the
entrance to the bowel and is jealous of anything
passing it which is likely to injure that canal.</p>

<p>And just as the pylorus protects the bowel so,
in exceptional cases, may the œsophagus protect
the stomach, regurgitating, after the fashion of
the ruminants, insufficiently masticated bits of
food, in order that they may be re-masticated.
I have myself met with cases in point. Sometimes,
in cases of this kind, the œsophagus
may be dilated into a sort of proventriculus,
which is capable of temporarily lodging a large
quantity of food. Such a proventriculus is said
to have developed in an apprentice who, not
being allowed sufficient time for his dinner,
rapidly bolted it, to regurgitate it after working
hours and to chew the cud at leisure. Whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in these cases the food is ever returned from
the stomach itself I am unable to say.</p>

<p>While the stomach is the organ especially
liable to be injured by the swallowing of lumps
of unmasticated food, the bowel may also suffer,
especially the cæcum and vermiform appendix.
And here we come to one of the most serious
indictments against the bolting of food; though
man has doubtless always suffered from appendicitis,
there can be little doubt that this malady
is more common now than it used to be; and
there is equally little doubt, in my own mind at
least, that the cause of its greater frequency is
related to his food. I do not propose to discuss
here in detail how food is capable of causing
appendicitis, but will merely refer to one of the
ways in which it may do so. I had already come
to the conclusion that the habit of bolting food
is a potent cause, when I read Sir Frederick
Treves’s Cavendish Lecture in which he makes
that contention. Sir Frederick Treves points
out that in this rushing age people, especially
business men, are apt to hurry over their meals
and to take them at irregular times and often
while standing at a bar; even when there is
more leisure, food is rarely masticated nowadays
in the same thorough way that it was in the old
time, when it was of a coarser nature: hence
solid lumps, especially in the case of such articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
as pine-apple, preserved ginger, nuts, tough
meat, and lobster, are apt to pass beyond the
pylorus and, escaping intestinal digestion, to
lodge in the cæcum and precipitate an attack
of appendicitis, the most common predisposing
cause of which is a loaded cæcum, often preceded
by constipation. Sir Frederick Treves
contends that this distended state of the cæcum
encourages catarrh of the appendix by dragging
upon it and blocking its orifice, as well as by
twisting it and thus interfering with its blood-supply.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><i>An excess of starch is apt to pass into the
stomach.</i>&mdash;We have just seen that inefficient
mastication tends to promote over-eating, and
what has been said on this head applies to all
kinds of food, starchy foods among others. It
leads, however, to a further evil as regards these
latter; not only does it tend unduly to increase
the quantity of them consumed, but it too often
causes the stomach and intestines to become
flooded with starch in a wholly undigested form.
I cannot too frequently repeat that in ancient
times, especially in the pre-cooking age, laborious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
mastication was needed in the case of all starchy
foods, partly because they were coarse and
fibrous, but chiefly because the starch and other
nutritive ingredients had, in order to become
available for nutrition, to be liberated from their
undigestible cellulose envelopes. In these days
of prepared, soft, starchy foods, however, mastication
is very little required for these purposes,
but in other respects it is as needful as ever,
indeed more needful, if the large quantities of
starch which are now consumed are to be insalivated
effectually. The laborious and sustained
mastication to which primitive man was compelled
to subject <i>his limited supplies of uncooked
starchy food, went far to effect complete digestion
of the starch within the mouth</i>, for raw starch is
freely digested by the saliva,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and hence in his
case <i>very little passed into the stomach in a wholly
undigested form</i>. How different is the case with
us moderns. Since the opening of the era of
agriculture and cooking, man has enormously
multiplied his supplies of saccharide, and he now
consumes large quantities of starch which has
been freed from its cellulose framework by cooking,
milling, grinding, and the like, and reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
to a soft or pappy form, such as milk puddings,
porridge, boiled potatoes, and new bread, all of
which can be swallowed with little or no preliminary
chewing; and when food can be
swallowed easily, without mastication, few will
take the trouble to masticate it. In these circumstances
the starch does not undergo adequate
salivary digestion, and a large quantity passes
wholly undigested into, and out of, the stomach,
not beginning to be digested until it reaches the
bowel. Small wonder that the latter should
rebel again this invasion and that flatulence,
pain, and other dyspeptic evils should result.</p>

<p>It is especially in young children that these
evils are observed. Too often the stomach of
the child, semi-carnivorous, remember, by its
ancestry, is literally deluged with pure starch.
At the seventh or eighth month, or even earlier,
for many of the patent infant foods contain it,
this substance is poured into the stomach without
being afforded any opportunity of undergoing
salivary digestion; and for a long time after
infancy large quantities are given in the liquid or
pultaceous form, such as rusks soaked in milk,
puddings, and mashed potatoes. This practice
of deluging the digestive organs with starch,
besides leading to the more immediate troubles
connected with flatulent dyspepsia, gives rise to
abundant formation of toxins which, by irritating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the alimentary mucous membrane, set up gastro-intestinal
catarrh; this, again, intensifies the
dyspepsia already existing and causes a still
further production of toxins, so that the motions
become intensely fœtid. These poisons being
absorbed into the blood the tissues become
saturated with them and the nutrition of the
entire organism is disturbed, the faulty metabolism
manifesting itself by a diminished resistance
to pathogenic agencies, by a tendency on
the part of the tissues to inflame (as shown by a
liability in children thus fed to bronchitis, rhinitis,
naso-pharyngitis, and tonsillitis), by their proneness
to tuberculosis, and finally by a disposition
to rickets, which I little doubt is essentially of
toxæmic origin.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned troubles an
excess of starch in the stomach may set up
hyperchlorhydria&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, that form of dyspepsia
in which there is excessive secretion of hydrochloric
acid. This affection occurs during the
most vigorous years of life and is apparently
due to excessive activity on the part of the
gastric glands. The excess of acid does not
give rise to any symptoms so long as there is
any unsatisfied proteid in the stomach to unite
with it, but directly all the proteid is satisfied
and free acid is present in the stomach, pain,
heartburn, and distention are apt to be felt; hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
these symptoms are generally removed temporarily
by a meal, the food ingested seizing upon
the free acid, and tend to recur in the course of
an hour or two. Other symptoms are mental
and bodily lassitude and great mental depression,
while, if the condition is long-continued, gastric
catarrh and dilatation ensue. Eructation of the
acrid mass, its removal with a tube, or its dilution
or neutralisation by an alkali, causes relief of the
symptoms. Now Dr. William Russell, who has
recently studied this form of dyspepsia, has
shown, and the fact is most significant from our
present point of view, that in it starch is the last
constituent to leave the stomach; that when this
organ has so far emptied itself as to contain but
one or two ounces of very acrid material the
residue consists chiefly of finely divided undigested
starch, which continues to stimulate the
gastric secretion; “and, there being no more
proteid with which to combine, the secretion
accumulates and leads to hyperacidity.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Inasmuch,
then, as inefficient mastication leads to an
excess of starch in the stomach, we see how it
may predispose to hyperchlorhydria and we
shall presently see that there is yet another
reason why it should do so.</p>

<p>It will be gathered from the foregoing that
thorough mastication is the most effective way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of securing efficient starch digestion. This
simple fact has been most strangely overlooked.
Thus “van Valzah considers that not a little of
the difficulty of the digestion of starches and
cereals can be overcome by more thorough cooking.
Patients who cannot eat potatoes after ordinary
cooking are [he urges] often able to digest
them very readily if they are doubly cooked
before being served. Cereals, as a rule, should
[he contends] be allowed to simmer all night
and then be thoroughly cooked for a half hour
in the morning before being eaten.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This is an
admirable illustration of the modern tendency to
cheat the mouth of its proper work. A much
more rational way of facilitating starch digestion
in those who experience a difficulty in this
respect is by efficient mastication.</p>

<p><i>Evils resulting from an insufficient quantity
of alkali in the stomach.</i>&mdash;I doubt if it is adequately
realised what a large amount of alkaline
saliva passes into the stomach as the result of
prolonged mastication. Its presence there serves
the useful purpose of prolonging the period of
starch digestion within the stomach, while it
further aids gastric digestion not only by exciting
the secretion of gastric juice, but also by its
influence on the reaction of the gastric contents;
it can scarcely be doubted that the effect is on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the whole one favourable to digestion in general.
We have just seen that defective mastication
may predispose to hyperchlorhydria by allowing
an excess of pure starch to pass into the stomach,
and I suggest that it may further operate in the
same direction by cheating the stomach of its
due supply of alkaline saliva. Now the saliva in
this affection is apt, as was pointed out by Sir
William Roberts, to be superalkaline, and for
this reason he recommended his acid-dyspeptics
to excite the flow of it by chewing gum-mastic
with the object of neutralising the gastric hyperacidity.
That relief can thus be obtained there
can be no doubt; but it is surely more rational
to get the patient to stimulate his salivary glands
by masticating actual food, by which we secure
the additional advantages accruing from its complete
insalivation and comminution as well as
from the reflex gastric effects. Actuated by
these considerations, I have long been in the
habit of recommending hyperchlorhydriacs to
subject their food to prolonged mastication, this
being, in my belief, the most rational and effective
way of breaking the stomach of its vicious habit.
In extreme cases we must insist that each morsel
of food should be chewed at least one hundred
times and not permit any relaxation of this
severe discipline, until the stomach has been
schooled into healthier ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
<i>Evils in connection with the jaws and their
appendages and the adjacent structures: the nasal
passages, naso-pharynx, and faucial tonsils.</i>&mdash;In
those who do not masticate properly in early life
these parts fail to develop as they should, and
they are on this account alone predisposed to
disease; their resistance to disease is still further
lowered by the fact of their blood and lymph
flow not being adequately stimulated by the vigorous
exercise of the masticatory muscles. Now
we have seen that the great cause of defective
mastication in children is the softness of the food
given them and that the feeding of them upon an
excess of soft food, especially the starchy kind,
disturbs digestion, induces toxæmia, and in this
way evokes a catarrhal tendency. In children
thus fed we have therefore several conditions
which make for disease in the parts under consideration&mdash;defective
development, sluggish circulation,
and toxic saturation. Is it any wonder
that the modern child should be liable to disease
in these regions, that he should so frequently
suffer from rhinitis, naso-pharyngitis, tonsillitis,
and from hypertrophy of the pharyngeal tonsil
(“adenoids”) and of the faucial tonsils?</p>

<p>It is in this way that I would explain the
frequency of adenoids among the children of
civilised communities. I claim, in fact, that this
disease is largely dietetic in origin. I submit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
that a child whose nasal apparatus and naso-pharynx
are well-grown and habitually bathed
by a stream of pure blood and lymph, periodically
accelerated by an ample and vigorous use
of the masticatory muscles, is unlikely to contract
adenoids. On the other hand, I contend
that a child in whom these parts are ill-developed
and bathed by an habitually sluggish stream of
tainted blood and lymph&mdash;one, <i>i. e.</i>, that is not
only poisoned, but rarely, if ever, hurried along
its lazy course by due exercise of the muscles of
mastication&mdash;I submit that such a child runs
great risk of contracting the disease. The
influence in setting up adenoids of toxic saturation
with its resulting catarrhal tendency is
shown by the frequency with which this affection
follows upon the rhinitis and naso-pharyngitis
of measles and diphtheria, and in order to realise
how greatly the circulation of blood and lymph in
the walls of the naso-pharynx must be influenced
by mastication, one has but to remember how
very closely the pterygoids are related to this
region; in exploring it for adenoids they can,
indeed, often be felt to stand out prominently.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>This, then, is my explanation of the truly
fearful prevalence of adenoids among the moderns.
It is essentially a disease of pap-fed
peoples. A child may, with the one exception
that he is fed on a pappy, super-saccharide diet,
be brought up under ideal health conditions.
He may live in the heart of a dry, open country,
far from the darkness, dust, and tainted
atmosphere of the town, sleep with the windows
open all night, live out of doors all day,
be fed on the most nourishing (too nourishing,
it may be) food, be clothed after the most approved
methods, and yet, in spite of all this,
we may find his naso-pharynx packed with
adenoids. This disease is, in fact, scarcely less
prevalent in the country than in the towns,
scarcely less common among the rich than
among the poor. Yet in primitive communities
it is practically unknown. And what, I would
ask, is the one condition in the material environment
of my supposititious child differing from
that of the primitive child? What but the factor
of diet? Therefore, I say, the prevalence of adenoids
among moderns must be the result of the
modern system of feeding children, and the defective
mastication which goes along with it.</p>

<p>That the foregoing is a grave indictment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
against that system, it need scarcely be said.
For adenoid disease is fraught with many evils,
among them mental hebetude, blocking of the
Eustachian tubes, and manifold other auditory
troubles, gastro-intestinal disturbances from the
passage into the stomach of unhealthy discharges,
and, most serious of all, nasal obstruction
and consequent mouth-breathing. So
serious are the evils connected with this latter
habit that they demand more than a passing
reference. Pronounced adenoid disease is always
associated with mouth-breathing, and
there can be no doubt that in the majority of
these cases, the nasal obstruction is not in the
nasal passages primarily, but is due to a blockage
of the posterior nares by the adenoid
growths, for it generally happens that nasal
breathing is rapidly re-established after their
removal, though in a certain proportion of
cases the obstruction still persists, and has to be
dealt with by treatment directed to the nasal
passages themselves. Some have, indeed, contended
that a primary nasal obstruction is one
important factor in the induction of adenoids,
leading as it does to a dry-cupping of the naso-pharynx
during inspiration and to a consequent
congestion of its lining membrane. I am
quite ready to allow that this mechanism may
play some part in causation, and such an assump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>tion
is in entire harmony with my main contention
that adenoid disease is of dietetic origin, for
nasal obstruction in children, other than that
caused by adenoids, is mainly due to defective
development of the nasal passages coupled with
inflammation of their lining membrane, both of
which conditions may, as we have seen, be essentially
the outcome of defective diet.</p>

<p>Coming now to the evils resulting from mouth-breathing,
we have first to remember that normally
the air is inhaled through the nose, and is
thus warmed, moistened, and filtered before
being allowed to pass into the lungs; but in the
mouth-breather the air, which may be dry,
cold, and dust-laden, passes at once unprepared
through the mouth into the lungs, impinging
in its passage against the pharynx,
thus drying and mechanically irritating the
mouth, pharynx, larynx, and bronchial tubes,
all of which are thereby predisposed to disease.
In this way laryngitis and bronchitis, nay, even
phthisis, may be induced. Dental caries is also
predisposed to by the habit of breathing through
the mouth. Mouth-breathing further interferes
with the proper development of the cranial
bones, but especially of the maxilla, giving rise
to what may be termed the “mouth-breather’s
jaw,” so characteristic is it I do not propose
to discuss here the mechanism by which this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
deformity is produced, interesting though the
question is; suffice it to say that nasal breathing
is essential to the normal development of the
jaws. The deformity in question, though it involves
the maxilla chiefly, affects also the mandible
from the fact of its being, to a large extent,
moulded on the maxilla; in typical cases the
maxilla is small and its alveolar ridge does
not attain its normal length, but is compressed
laterally towards the sagittal plane, giving rise
to the false appearance of a “high arch” and
often thrusting the anterior portion of the ridge
forwards; the teeth, the growth of which is not
so much interfered with as that of the imbedding
bone, are thus prevented from taking up their
proper positions and show irregularity, sometimes
extreme. Dental irregularity may also, as
we shall see, result from inadequate use of the
jaws in mastication, but not to the extent which
is frequently observed in the mouth-breather’s
jaws, and therefore pronounced dental irregularity
always shows that there has been protracted
nasal obstruction, and this in the vast majority
of cases implies the existence of adenoids, past
or present; I say in the “vast majority,” for in
a few rare cases long-continued nasal obstruction
in children originates primarily in the nose
and may lead to the typical mouth-breather’s
jaw, with the resulting dental irregularity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p><i>The tongue.</i>&mdash;If the tongue is not properly
exercised in childhood and youth, we find it
imperfectly developed; hence in inefficient masticators
it is generally small. It must not be
forgotten in this connection that this organ is
considerably exercised when the infant is at the
breast, from which the milk is obtained, not by
suction, but by a vigorous tugging and squeezing
of the nipple (in which the tongue takes
considerable part), whereby the gland is reflexly
excited to secrete. When, on the other hand,
the child feeds at the bottle he obtains his milk
by actual suction, and generally through an
orifice of such ample dimensions as to allow
the bottle to be rapidly emptied with comparatively
little exercise of the lips and tongue.
In short, the breast-fed infant has to do some
work for his living, and that of a sort calculated
to promote the health of the jaws and their appendages,
while the bottle-fed child can glut
himself by doing very little more than opening
his mouth; wherefore we find the tongue and
adjacent parts less developed in the latter than
in the former. It may be thought to be a matter
of indifference whether the tongue develops
to its normal proportions or remains small, but
such is by no means the case, for, as Dr. J. Sim
Wallace has shown, the pressure of this structure
against the teeth promotes the normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
development of the jaws, especially of the mandible,
and when it is small they are apt to be
so too.</p>

<p><i>The salivary glands.</i>&mdash;Just as mastication
increases the functional activity of the salivary
glands and buccal glands and favours their normal
development, so, contrariwise, inefficient
mastication during early life fails to call forth
their normal functional activity and to secure
their adequate development. Thus we find
that a child who has been brought up on hard,
starchy foods, necessitating abundant mastication
has much larger and more active salivary
glands than one who has been fed on soft foods
which slip down into the stomach before they
have had the chance of being properly masticated,
and it is needless to say that the more
efficient these glands are the more likely is
digestion to be carried out satisfactorily.</p>

<p><i>The jaw-bones.</i>&mdash;If the jaws are not adequately
exercised in youth by mastication they
fail to grow to their normal size and shape, and
there is apt in consequence to be overcrowding
of the teeth. The main defect of the jaws in
such cases is their smallness; they do not present
that pronounced lateral compression and
anterior protrusion which characterise the
mouth-breather’s jaw, nor such extreme dental
irregularity, the most common being overlap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>ping
of the incisors, displacement of the canines,
and difficulties in regard to the eruption of the
wisdom teeth from shortness of the alveolar
ridge. I have already referred to the progressive
shortening in the post-molar ridge, which
has been taking place during man’s evolution
from the anthropoid in correspondence with the
alteration in his diet.</p>

<p>We thus see that defective use of the jaws
leads to irregularity of the teeth (1) directly
and (2) indirectly through the induction of
adenoids. This irregularity is not only unsightly
but leads to certain evils which thus primarily
owe their origin, in large measure at
least, to defective mastication. What, then, are
these evils? In the first place, dental irregularity
predisposes to dental caries by favouring the
lodgement of food between the teeth; in the
next place, it leads to defective “bite.” Now
when the bite is defective adequate mastication
is impossible, for not only is it impossible in
these circumstances to oppose the teeth properly,
but also, owing to their interlocking, to
accomplish that free lateral movement of the
lower teeth against the upper, which belongs to
normal mastication. I do not say that defective
bite is the sole cause of this imperfect lateral
movement; it may, indeed, be observed in
most moderns brought up on soft pappy food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
whether the bite be good or not. Normal mastication
is, in fact, becoming a lost art; the
average modern masticates mainly by a vertical
compression of the lower teeth against the
upper, and in only a small degree by a lateral
frictional movement which, it is needless to say,
is the more effective method for grinding purposes;
and it is, I doubt not, chiefly for this
reason that the teeth of modern man are so
much less worn down than those of primitive
peoples.</p>

<p><i>The teeth.</i>&mdash;Imperfect use of the teeth leads
to many ills. When adequately exercised and
made to execute for one or two hours every
day a lively dance in their sockets, during
which the circulation of blood and lymph in
the tooth-pulp, periodontal membrane, and surrounding
tissue of the gum is vigorously stimulated,
and the cavity of the mouth is bathed
in a copious flow of salivary and other buccal
secretions, we have conditions which make alike
for the health of the buccal mucous membrane,
of the teeth, and of the periodontal membrane
and alveoli; but when the circulation is not duly
stimulated in this way the teeth do not develop
properly, while the secretions of the mouth are
apt to be scanty and unhealthy, both of which
conditions predispose to caries. How far dental
caries is due to inherent dental weakness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
how far to faulty conditions outside the teeth
we need not stop to inquire; Dr. Wallace attributes
little influence to the former factor, contending
that caries depends essentially upon
faulty dental environment; and one can scarcely
doubt that the state of the gums and of the oral
secretions profoundly influences the growth of
bacteria in the mouth, upon the acid yielded by
which organisms the corrosion of the dental
enamel essentially depends. Faulty conditions
of the oral secretions likewise favour the deposit
of tartar.</p>

<p>Another result of imperfect use of the teeth
is undue thinness of the alveolar walls and periodontal
membrane, in consequence of which the
teeth are not so firmly held in their sockets as
they should be. This is, I believe, one of the
reasons why they are prone to fall out prematurely
among the moderns: we know that the
teeth tend to drop out in old people owing to a
senile atrophy of the alveolar walls; the Haversian
canals get smaller and may, indeed, disappear
entirely, and it stands to reason that this
atrophy must be hastened by inefficient exercise
of the teeth. So far as I am able to gather
from an examination of skulls in museums, the
teeth are rarely shed among primitive peoples
before extreme old age, while among moderns
they frequently fall out long ere this is attained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>A still worse evil attaching to insufficient
use of the teeth is pyorrhœa alveolaris or
Riggs’s disease, which, in conjunction with the
deposit of tartar, is the great cause of the premature
loosening and shedding of the teeth
observed among latter-day civilised peoples.
This affection consists of a purulent inflammation
of the periodontal membrane, owing to the
invasion of it by pyogenic cocci, so that pus
wells up on pressing the gum against the teeth.
Now, when by a vigorous use of the teeth the
buccal cavity is kept well flushed with healthy
secretions, the growth of micro-organisms within
this chamber is kept down, and when, by the
same means, the vitality of the periodontal
membrane and adjacent tissues of the gum is
periodically stimulated, these tissues offer stout
resistance to the invasion of pathogenic organisms;
but when, contrariwise, the teeth are little
used, the secretions of the mouth are in consequence
defective both as to quality and quantity,
and the growth of organisms in the buccal
cavity is promoted; and when, further, the circulation
in the periodontal membrane and adjacent
soft tissues is not adequately stimulated by
vigorous mastication, their vitality is poor and
they offer but a feeble resistance to parasitic
invasion. We can thus, I think, safely infer that
inefficient mastication is a potent cause of pyor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>rhœa
alveolaris; and the chief cause of inefficient
mastication being the eating of soft foods,
we must also conclude that the latter practice
is chiefly responsible for the disease in question;
such foods further predispose to this affection
in that they are apt to lodge between the
teeth and by undergoing decomposition there
to favour the growth of micro-organisms within
the mouth. The condition of the teeth and
gums among the civilised poor is, alas, little calculated
to make us proud of our boasted civilisation&mdash;the
spongy pus-exuding gums, the
lengthening, loose, tartar-covered, carious teeth,
and the putrescent breath constitute a damning
indictment against our modern system of living
on a soft, pappy diet, and not giving the teeth
the work for which they are designed. I never
examine such a mouth without being impressed
with, and I may add oppressed by, this fact.</p>

<p>I am not, of course, contending that pyorrhœa
alveolaris only occurs in those who masticate
inefficiently; whatever causes an unhealthy
condition of the gums and saliva predisposes to
it, but it is surely much less common in those
who masticate well than in those who masticate
ill. Confirmatory of this statement is the fact
that it is more frequent in those with irregular
teeth than in those with a good bite, who
are thus able to put their teeth to more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
effective use. This affection is very common
among the carnivora of menageries as well
as among dogs and cats; indeed, one seldom
fails to find it in dogs over four years of age,
and in old dogs it is generally rampant. Doubtless
in all these cases the general conditions of
life play some part in the causation of the disease,
but I do not think that we can eliminate
from it the factor of defective use of the jaws
and teeth, for it is certain that dogs and cats
are fed largely on pappy foods and are often
insufficiently supplied with bones.</p>

<p><i>The causation of dental caries.</i>&mdash;Dr. Wallace,
in his philosophical work on “The Cause and
Prevention of Decay in Teeth,” contends that
the cause of the prevalence of dental caries is
that the natural food-stuffs are, to a large extent,
ridded of their accompanying fibrous parts and
consumed in a form which renders them liable
to lodge and to undergo acid fermentation in
the mouth; while from the same cause and the
induced conditions the micro-organisms of the
mouth lodge and multiply and augment the rapidity
and intensity of the acid fermentation.
I am perfectly at one with Dr. Wallace in believing
that the removal of the fibrous portions
of food is the main cause of the prevalence of
caries among moderns, and I can hardly doubt
that foods so prepared tend to promote caries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
in the way indicated, but I venture to think that
they do this even more by failing to call forth
the normal degree of mastication. I cannot but
think that if these same soft foods were as laboriously
masticated as they would need to be if
they retained their fibrous ingredients, dental
caries would be much less common than it actually
is. I have endeavoured to show how very
different the local conditions are in the efficient
from what they are in the inefficient masticator&mdash;how
in the former the jaws and teeth are
wont to be well developed, the bite to be good,
and the secretions which bathe the teeth to be of
a kind calculated to promote their health; and
how in the latter an entirely opposite set of conditions
is wont to prevail. That it is possible
to maintain a fine set of healthy teeth till past
middle life on ordinary civilised diet, provided
the food be habitually subjected to efficient
mastication, is shown in the case of the man
already referred to, and by numerous other cases
which I have observed.</p>

<p>Since the application of cooking to food
there has been a progressive lessening in the
work of the jaws and teeth and, parallel with this,
a diminution in their size and an incursion of
dental caries. Among the anthropoids in their
natural state caries is practically unknown, and
I think we may conclude that the same was true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
of man before he learnt to cook. In the pre-agricultural
races, such as the aboriginal Australians,
the effect of cooking the food is shown
in the lessening in the size of the wisdom teeth
and of the post-wisdom alveolar ridge; dental
caries, though rare among these people, does
occur, and especially in the wisdom teeth.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
In the early agricultural period, owing to the
increasing softness of the vegetable food, the
jaws and teeth show a tendency to be smaller
than in the previous periods; the wisdom teeth
are decidedly smaller and more prone to caries,
while caries of the other teeth is by no means
rare. In the late agricultural period the jaws
and teeth often show very decided defects of
development, while dental caries is, as we know
but too well, rampant.</p>

<p>What has been said concerning the relative
prevalence of caries in different diet epochs applies
to many other diseases of the teeth; thus,
along with the increase of caries, there has been
a parallel increase in the prevalence of pyorrhœa
alveolaris.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="CONCLUDING_REMARKS">CONCLUDING REMARKS</h4>



<p>I have now set forth some of the evils resulting
from inefficient mastication. They are many
and serious. The immediate evils, such as
over-eating, indigestion, adenoids, dental caries,
and pyorrhœa alveolaris, are bad enough, but
when we consider the secondary evils to which
these primary ones give rise,&mdash;and I have only
mentioned a few of them,&mdash;we must come to the
conclusion that an appalling amount of misery
and suffering may be saved by the simple expedient
of inculcating the habit of efficient mastication.
How this end can best be accomplished
will be considered in the next section.</p>


<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">Section IV.</span> From <i>London Lancet</i>, August 8, 1903</p>

<h4>MEANS OF INSURING ADEQUATE
MASTICATION</h4>


<p>In order to secure the full advantages accruing
from the use of the jaws and their appendages,
it is, above all, necessary for them to
be adequately exercised during the period of
development. If this is done, not only will
the tendency to dental caries, adenoids, indiges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>tion,
and other evils be greatly diminished, but
the masticatory instinct will establish itself as a
permanent force, so that the individual will tend
for the rest of his life to subject even soft foods
to thorough mastication. The tongue, the lips,
and the jaws of the newly born child find their
natural exercise at the mother’s breast, and we
should, therefore, do our utmost to get the
mother to suckle her child, the bottle affording
neither the same kind nor the same amount of
exercise. If, unhappily, we fail in this, we must
see that the teat of the feeding-bottle is so constructed
as to compel the child to earn his meal
by, at any rate, some exercise. This kind of
exercise promotes the growth of the tongue and
thus of the jaws, especially of the mandible.
Directly the infant shows a disposition to bite
hard things the instinct should be gratified. We
may observe a tendency in this direction as
early as the third or fourth month, and it
becomes more and more pronounced when, the
time for the eruption of the teeth approaching,
the gums begin to swell up and to get tender,
and saliva begins to flow from the mouth; it is
now, more than ever, necessary to provide the
child with hard substances on which to exercise
the jaws and the gums, and a great deal of the
trouble of teething is due to the failure to recognise
this fact. What, then, are we to employ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
for this purpose? I am convinced that it is a
mistake to rely solely, or even mainly, upon
baubles of ivory, coral, and the like useful
though these may be in their way; it is far
better to give the child something which is not
only hard but nutrient and pleasant to the taste,
something which will at one and the same time
exercise the maxillary apparatus, excite the
gustatory organs, and provide a certain amount
of nutriment. To this end we may, as the teething
time approaches, give a chop or chicken
bone, from which most of the meat has been
removed; by powdering the bone with white
sugar or salt we may increase its attractiveness.
From such bones a good deal of nutriment can
be extracted, and this of a kind which is most
acceptable to the infant stomach, for it must be
remembered that the young human is in the
main carnivorous. Indeed, since milk is a purely
animal diet, all the mammals must be regarded
as essentially carnivorous during the period of
suckling, while man, as already observed, from
the time he emerged from the anthropoid until
he learned to cook his food, was throughout life
mainly an animal feeder. Therefore we should
not hesitate to allow the teething infant animal
food in the form suggested. Chicken and chop
bones, yielding as they do before the pressure
on the gums, are, moreover, just of the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
degree of consistence for the purpose in view,
while they afford abundant exercise for the
tongue; ivory, coral, and the like are, on the
other hand, too hard and unyielding, and lack,
moreover, the attractiveness belonging to sapidity.</p>

<p>By thus providing the maxillary apparatus
with suitable exercise we shall do much to facilitate
the eruption of the teeth and to favour the
growth of the jaws and their appendages, including
the salivary glands, and so to prepare
the mouth for the reception of vegetable food.
This should, of course, not be given till the
teeth appear. The order in which these make
their appearance gives some indication as to the
order in which vegetable food should be administered
to the child. The first teeth to penetrate
the gums are the lower incisors which appear
from the seventh to the eighth month; then
follow the upper incisors from the seventh to the
tenth month. These teeth enable the child to
<i>bite</i>, but not, be it observed, to <i>masticate</i>, for
which function the molars are necessary. Now
the first molars do not appear till the twelfth or
fourteenth month; the second molars not till
between the fourteenth and the twentieth month;
and it seems to me certain that our primitive
ancestors could not have obtained starch in any
quantity until they reached this age; at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
best, pre-cooking man was but scantily supplied
with starch, and such slender supply as he had
could only be rendered accessible to the digestive
juices by vigorous mastication, which broke
up the indigestible cellulose framework in which
all vegetable starch is contained; hence, until
the young human cut his molars, he had little
opportunity of securing any starch. These considerations
strongly suggest the desirability of
giving but small quantities of starch before the
twelfth month, and though the facts, that ptyaline
appears in the saliva about the time the first
incisors are cut, and that pancreatic juice develops
its amylolytic ferment at the same time,
show that the digestive organs are ready for the
reception of some starch at the seventh or
eighth month, yet I believe the quantity should
be strictly limited. I am ready to admit that
the modern child may have, indeed probably
has, a greater power of digesting starch than
his remote pre-agricultural ancestor; but even
so, I am convinced that we should be on our
guard not to over-gorge infants with this substance.
Only a small quantity should be given
before the twelfth month, and it should be gradually
increased up to the twentieth month.</p>

<p>I have said that the pre-agricultural infant
was unable to secure starch in any quantity by
means of his incisors. These teeth enabled him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
however, to obtain some soluble nutriment from
fruits, and Dr. Sim Wallace has suggested that
the early eruption of the lower incisors is for the
purpose of enabling the infant to pierce the
outer covering of fruits so as to permit him to
extract the soluble contents by suction; and,
accordingly, when these teeth are cut we may
allow the child to bite at such vegetable
substances as apples, oranges, and sugar-cane.
The latter is a useful article of diet for children,
for it provides soluble saccharide in a diluted
form, and it is advisable that the child should
receive his cane sugar well diluted, for it must
be remembered that before the agricultural
period man’s supply of pure sugar was limited
to wild honey which, consisting as it does almost
entirely of mono-saccharide (grape sugar and
fruit sugar), is very easily disposed of by the
digestive organs. Nowadays, the less digestible
cane sugar (which is a di-saccharide) is very
largely consumed in the undiluted state, in which
it is apt to set up disturbance. When, however,
it is obtained by chewing the sugar-cane,
it is diluted both by the water in the cane and
by the saliva, and I should like to see children
obtain most of their cane sugar in this way.</p>

<p>The consideration of the conditions obtaining
for pre-agricultural man not only strongly suggests
that the young human of to-day should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
be given starch in very moderate quantities up
to the twelfth month, but it points an even more
important lesson&mdash;viz., that this substance
should be given not, as is the custom, as liquid
or pap, but in a form compelling vigorous mastication,
for it is certain that early man, from
the time he emerged from the ape till he discovered
how to cook his vegetable food, obtained
practically all his starch in such a form; it cannot
too often be repeated that uncooked starch
in the natural state, locked up as it is in chambers
of indigestible cellulose, has no nutritive
value; these chambers need first to be broken
up by prolonged and energetic chewing, and
in this way much or most of the starch is converted
in the mouth into dextrines and maltose,
very little passing into the stomach in the crude
state to set up disturbance in that organ and
later in the bowel. If it is given as liquid or
pap it will pass down as starch into the stomach,
while if it is administered in a form which
obliges the child to chew it properly, not only
will the jaws, the teeth, and the gums obtain the
exercise which they crave, and without which
they cannot develop normally, but the starch
will be so thoroughly insalivated that much of
it will be converted within the mouth into maltose.
How foolish to upset the child’s digestive
system by deluging it with liquid starch, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
then to endeavour to correct matters by giving
the malt extract which the child can and should
himself manufacture within the laboratory of
his buccal cavity.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, the child should make his first
acquaintance with starch, not in the form of a
liquid or pappy patent food, but in a solid and
somewhat tough form. The best means of
achieving this end is occupying my attention,
and I hope soon to publish the results of my
investigation. Meanwhile, I would point out
that hard, well-baked crusts constitute a convenient
form in which to administer starch to
children. A piece of crust may be put in the
oven and re-baked; this not only hardens it but
helps to convert the starch into dextrine, which
is a stage on the road to maltose. If the crust
be then cut into a suitable shape and spread
with bacon fat or fresh butter, it constitutes a
most agreeable morsel. Later, we may give hard
plain biscuits. The same principle should be
acted upon during later childhood and youth:
we should always give, as far as possible, the
starch in a form compelling abundant mastication.
Loaves should be shaped so as to give a
maximum of crust and a minimum of crumb,
and should be baked hard. Such loaves are
quite as nutritious as the ordinary ones, and
much more digestible, containing as they do an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
abundance of dextrine and not a little maltose,
and compelling efficient mastication, especially
if eaten, as they should be, without any fluid.
A lady who has the catering for a large number
of girls gives the bread in this way, and she
tells me that there is keen competition for the
most crusty portions.</p>

<p>I do not say that starch in the liquid and
pappy form should find no place whatever in
man’s dietary at the present day, for this would
imply the prohibition of porridge, boiled potatoes,
milk puddings, and the like. We cannot
put back the hand of time and return to the
food of our primitive ancestors, nor is it desirable
that we should; but we can, at least, arrange
matters so that a large proportion of the starch
we consume shall be in a form inviting mastication,
such as crusts, stale bread, stale cake,
biscuits, and so forth. The less children eat of
pastry, or, indeed, of any luxurious foods, the
better; if brought up on a healthy dietary and
under healthy conditions generally, they will
relish their simple fare more than the choicest
dishes of the epicure. I do not, I say, object
to the child consuming a certain proportion of
starch in the liquid or pultaceous form, for if,
by bringing him up on a rational dietary, his
instinct to masticate be afforded due opportunity
to develop he will be likely to subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
even soft vegetable food to something like
adequate mastication; this will tend to mitigate
the evils associated with such food, not only by
facilitating the digestion of starch, but by flushing
the mouth and promoting the health of the
teeth and buccal mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The question how far children should be
allowed to crack nuts may here be considered.
If the child has been brought up on pappy food,
and has in consequence brittle and ill-developed
teeth, the cracking of hard nuts will be likely to
injure them, and this is <i>a fortiori</i> true if any of
the teeth are carious or “filled.” And not
only nuts but hard food of any kind, such as
ship’s biscuits, may in these circumstances injure
the teeth, as many of those who went
through the recent South African campaign can
testify. But if, on the other hand, the child has
from the beginning been fed on coarse, hard
foods, so that the teeth have been allowed to
grow dense and strong, no harm is likely to
ensue from cracking such nuts as filberts and
Spanish nuts. If a squirrel or a monkey weighing
a few pounds can do so with impunity,
surely the young human should be able to
also. The cracking should, however, be done
by the molars, while such hard nuts as Brazils
had best not be tackled at all.</p>

<p>Animal food does not need the same amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of mastication as vegetable food, since it
is not digested in the mouth, though some
contend that the mixture of proteid with alkaline
saliva facilitates its subsequent peptonisation.
Cooked animal food is, however, all
the better for some mastication, owing to the
coagulation of the proteids, and, in order to
insure the efficient mastication of meat, fish, and
poultry, Dr. Sim Wallace recommends that they
should be given in large pieces cut thin. “Flat
pieces about one inch square generally <i>necessitate</i>
a certain amount of mastication. It is
difficult to swallow large flat pieces of meat
without mastication, but when finely minced
little or no mastication is called forth.” The
younger the child the more underdone should
the meat be.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Examination of the Mouth and Adjacent
Parts</span></h5>

<p>If a child be brought up on the lines indicated
and under healthy conditions generally, it
is tolerably certain that the maxillary apparatus
will develop normally, that the teeth will be
strong and well opposed, and show little tendency
to disease; but, inasmuch as the methods
advocated are but seldom put into practice, disorders
of the teeth, more especially caries and
irregularities, are common, and hence with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
view to promote more efficient mastication it is
always advisable to examine our patient’s teeth.</p>

<p>Each individual tooth should be inspected in
a good light for the presence of caries, and careful
note should be taken of the “bite,” a normal
bite implying not only a proper opposition of
the two rows of teeth but the capacity of the
lower ones to move freely across the upper;
mere vertical movement of the mandible does
not constitute efficient mastication. In this
connection it must not be forgotten that an
unopposed molar is useless for purposes of
mastication, and it is by no means rare to find
in a mouth several sound unopposed molars
which are for this reason absolutely functionless.
Nay, more than this, it may happen
that teeth, perfectly sound ones, too, far from
helping, may actually interfere with mastication;
thus, among the poor, we sometimes find
all the teeth gone save the upper canines and
the lower incisors, and the teeth and gums being
alike unable to come into contact, nothing worthy
of the name of mastication is possible; it would
be far better to be without any teeth whatever,
for the toothless gums would then be permitted
to come into contact along their entire extent,
under which condition they gradually harden
and come to be quite efficient grinding agents.</p>

<p>Next the gums, the alveoli, and the roots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the teeth must be examined, especially for the
presence of erosion, tartar, and pyorrhœa alveolaris,
this latter condition being evidenced by
the welling-up of pus upon pressing the gums
against the sides of the teeth.</p>

<p>If our examination of the mouth discloses
anything likely to interfere with mastication the
aid of the dentist should at once be sought, but
every physician should be so far acquainted with
disorders of the teeth as to be able to say, in the
majority of cases, at all events, when this is
necessary. I am convinced that far more illness
than is generally supposed is attributable to
dental defects, and this even among the more
leisured classes. With regard to pyorrhœa
alveolaris, it has to be remembered that it not
only does harm by causing loosening, lengthening,
and shedding of the teeth, and thus interfering
with mastication, but also by contaminating
the stomach and the blood and thus upsetting
the digestion and causing constitutional diseases,
such as anæmia and arthritis; and inasmuch as
poisonous discharges from the nose, the naso-pharynx,
the pharynx, and the tonsils may act
in a similar way, these parts also should be
inspected in connection with the examination of
the teeth. In the dust-laden atmosphere of
towns they are very liable to disease, and even
when healthy are necessarily dirtied; some go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
so far as to advise all town dwellers daily to
wash out the nasal passages and to gargle the
throat; but, whatever may be thought of this, it
is certain that under existing dietetic conditions
special means are needed in order to keep the
mouth and teeth clean. When man fed on raw
food this was not necessary, the food itself and
the copious flow of saliva, induced by prolonged
mastication, effectually cleansing these parts;
but, under present conditions, food tends to
remain within the mouth, especially between
the teeth and in their crevices, and therefore
special means are needed to remove it. This is
done by “cleaning the teeth” and by rinsing the
mouth.</p>

<p><i>The tooth-brush.</i>&mdash;Probably the ideal method
of cleaning the teeth is that adopted by many
primitive and not a few semi-civilised peoples&mdash;viz.,
rubbing them with a twig of wood which
has been teased out at one end so as to form a
sort of brush by means of which the teeth can
be burnished and food dislodged from them.
The modern tooth-brush requires to be used
with great caution, as it is capable of doing much
harm, not only by removing the mucoid film,
which, according to Dr. Wallace, protects the
teeth from corroding agencies,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
also by injuring the edge of the gum and the
neck of the teeth, and thus setting up the condition
known as “erosion.” Certain it is that
some of the best sets of teeth I have encountered
have been wholly unacquainted with the tooth-brush.
In any case the brush should be employed
with great care; it should be soft, and
should always be drawn away from the gums
both on the inner and outer aspect of the teeth
towards the biting surface, as well as across the
latter, never transversely across the outer surfaces,
as so frequently is done. The object of
these procedures is to dislodge any particles of
food that may have collected between the teeth
or in their crevices. For this purpose the toothpick
may also be employed judiciously. In
order to render the enamel of the teeth white it
is better to rub each tooth carefully with some
soft material, such as chamois leather, rather
than to scrub them with a brush. Tooth-powders
should not be used as a matter of routine,
but only occasionally and for appearance rather
than for cleanliness, and should consist of some
simple non-irritant material. Antiseptic powders
and washes are to be scrupulously avoided,
for it is neither desirable nor possible to render
the buccal cavity aseptic; myriads of bacteria
flourish within it, many of which play a useful
part as scavengers. The time of all others for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
cleaning the teeth is just before going to bed,
so that the food shall not be allowed to decompose
in the mouth during the night. There will
then be no need to use the tooth-brush in the
morning.</p>

<p><i>Rinsing the mouth.</i>&mdash;The mouth should be
rinsed out as a matter of routine after each
meal and on rising, and care should be taken to
do this before the early cup of tea, so as not to
contaminate the stomach with the buccal secretions
which have accumulated during the night.
Inasmuch as raw vegetable food has a cleansing
effect on the teeth, it is often a wise plan, especially
in the case of children, to finish a meal
with some kind of fruit, such as an apple or an
orange. It hardly seems necessary to insist

<h3 class="hang">PROFESSOR PAWLOW’S DEMONSTRATIONS
OF PSYCHIC INFLUENCE IN
DIGESTION</h3>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In presenting a theory of human alimentation involving
mental or nervous as well as mechanical and chemical factors
which influence it for good, it is not often that an author is
able to enlist the assistance of a complete battery of scientific
confirmation to fortify his own crude observations taken direct
from personal experience in the study of natural requirements.</p>

<p>Professor Pawlow, with his marvellously skilful investigation
of the workings of the digestive secretions, and Dr.
Cannon of the Harvard Medical School, by aid of persistent
and patient X-ray studies, explain how it is that earned
appetite and thorough mouth-treatment of food are preliminary
necessities of easy digestion, and that disturbance or
shock of any sort during the process stop digestive proceedings
and endanger health. They show also that when the
mouth is used to do <i>all that it can do</i> in the work of digestion
all the rest is easily accomplished by the <span class="smcap">Natural Automatic
Processes</span> within the body.</p>

<p>They both show that we have, each of us, a certain responsibility
in the matter of right digestion and healthy nutrition,
and that all this personal responsibility is located in the head,
in the mind, and in the mouth, and that while the alimentation
is proceeding it is a sacred duty to do our part <i>right</i>, according
to the intelligence that these most valuable demonstrations
teach.</p>

<p>Professor Pawlow has allowed publication of his lectures in
Russian and German, and recently Professor W. H. Thompson
of the Physiological Department of Trinity College,
Dublin, has made an English translation which is issued by
Charles Griffin &amp; Company of London and J. B. Lippincott of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>The author has to express special gratitude to Professor
Pawlow, Professor Thompson, Messrs Griffin and Lippincott
for permission to reprint herein some entire lectures and extracts
that bear especially on the practical understanding of
our subject.</p>

<p>Professor Pawlow is one of the Board of Scientific Assessors
mentioned in the <span class="allsmcap">REPORT</span> of a <span class="allsmcap">PLAN</span> for an <span class="smcap">International
Inquiry</span> into the subject of <span class="smcap">Human Nutrition</span>.</p>

<p>In one of the lectures, not here reprinted, Professor Pawlow
gives merited recognition of the early statements of the
French physiologist Blondlot relative to psychic influence on
the digestive secretions made some half century ago, but discredited
by physiologists since that time, owing to insufficiency
of evidence brought forward in support of the statements.</p>

<p>Professor Pawlow’s acknowledgment is so gracefully rendered
that it is here given as a model of scientific courtesy.</p>

<p>“I have depicted the work of the gastric glands as we have
seen it in our experiments, and as it has developed under our
hands. Is the picture a new one? In its details, yes; but not
in its fundamental features. However singular it may appear,
the sketch of this picture was more than fifty years ago outlined
by physiology. May this constitute another reason for
our science relinquishing its characteristic shyness of new
things and for its conversion to our interpretation of the
phenomena under consideration!</p>

<p>“The talented author of the <i>Traité Analytique de la Digestion</i>&mdash;Blondlot&mdash;spoke
in plain words of the importance of
taking food, and of the specific excitability of the gastric
mucous membrane. The facts adduced in the working up of
his theory were naturally insufficient, but we must not forget
that the first experiments on dogs with artificial gastric
fistulæ had only just been performed. It is truly incomprehensible
that the researches of Blondlot and his views upon
the secretion of gastric juice have experienced during the past
fifty years no completion, no additions, but, on the contrary,
have passed out of sight, thanks to the faulty experiments and
erroneous representations of later authors. Only in the
works of a few writers&mdash;and those mostly French&mdash;has
Blondlot’s theory survived. Of other investigators we must
give mention to Heidenhain, who has enriched the physiology
of absorption in general, but more especially, in connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
with the secretory work of the stomach, has discovered many
important facts and has given birth to many fruitful ideas.
From him proceed the subdivision of the secretory process
according to periods and exciting agencies, as well as the suggestion
that it would be important to investigate the individual
food-stuffs in relation to the work of the stomach. Heidenhain’s
results are contained in his well-known article on
the secretion of the cardiac glands of the stomach, published
in the year 1879 in <span class="smcap">Pflüger’s Archives</span>. The work of
Blondlot and the additions of Heidenhain comprise almost
everything of importance which was accomplished by physiology
in fifty years concerning the conditions and mechanism of
the secretory work of the stomach during digestion. Full of
moment, however, for our subject was the obvious error that
mechanical stimulation constituted an effective excitant of the
gastric glands, and this error was in its turn a result of faulty
methods.”—<span class="smcap">Horace Fletcher.</span>]</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;As you have learned in the
last lecture, and also in part have seen by direct
experiment, the nervous system can influence
the work of our glands in the most diverse
ways. The vagus nerve, already burdened with
many duties, has, in addition, proved itself to
be an undoubted exciter of the gastric glands
and of the pancreas. But we must also assign
to the sympathetic nerve a similar <i>rôle</i>. This is
a matter which cannot be doubted, so far as the
pancreas is concerned, and is highly probable
as regards the stomach. We also saw good
reason for believing that these two nerves contained
two different classes of fibres, secretory
and trophic, a condition which had already been
proved to exist by Heidenhain for the nerves of
the salivary glands. As a hypothesis we might
even have proceeded a step farther and have
divided Heidenhain’s trophic nerves into separate
classes of secretory fibres. Lastly, we advanced
important experimental evidence to
show the existence of special inhibitory fibres
to the glands, and these fibres also run in the
vagus, the list of whose functions seems almost
interminable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>We obtained these results by division and artificial
excitation of the nerves which run to the
glands. But when, how, and by what means these
nerves are thrown into activity during the normal
course of physiological events remains a question.</p>

<p>In order to avoid repetition, and at the same
time impart the utmost clearness to our representation,
it may be useful to bring before your
minds at once the plan of innervation of a given
organ, all the more since this scheme is seldom
completely followed out or adequately described
in physiological text-books. Consequently, it
is not borne in mind with sufficient precision by
the majority of medical men.</p>

<p>A complete innervation mechanism consists
of the peripheral endings of the centripetal
(afferent) nerves, the centripetal nerves themselves,
the nerve cells (a group of nerve cells
connected with each other is termed a “nerve
centre”), the centrifugal (efferent) nerves, and,
lastly, their peripheral terminations. Physiology
now accepts it as a settled fact, that nerve
fibres serve only as <i>conductors</i> of nervous impulses,
which come in from contiguous links of
the nervous chain. Only the peripheral endings
of nerves and the nerve cells themselves have
the power of transforming the external stimulus<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
into a nervous impulse. In other words, in the
intact organism these alone constitute the normal
receiving apparatus of the nervous system.
Whether the peripheral ends of centrifugal
(efferent) nerves are likewise able to function
as normal sites for the application of external
stimuli has still to be answered. Consequently,
when any external agency excites the peripheral
terminations&mdash;the receiving stations&mdash;of centripetal
nerves in this or that organ, the effect
of the stimulus will be conveyed through the
centripetal nerves, as through a receiving wire,
to the central station&mdash;the nerve cells. Here
it becomes changed into a definite impulse and
now comes back along the centrifugal nerves&mdash;the
outgoing wires.</p>

<p>The utmost importance is to be attached to
the fact that only the peripheral endings of centripetal
(afferent) nerves, in contrast to nerve
fibres themselves, respond to <i>specific</i> stimuli;
that is to say, are able to transform definite
kinds of external stimuli into nervous impulses.
The function of the end organs with which they
are connected is therefore of a purposive nature;
in other words, these organs are only called into
play by certain definite conditions, and impart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
the idea of being aware of their purpose, of
being conscious of their duty. We have long
known that the peripheral endings of sensory
nerves are possessed of a high degree of speciality,
and cannot therefore have any doubt regarding
the specific nature of the end organs of
other centripetal nerves. This is a sore point
in present-day physiology. But, notwithstanding
our knowledge of the separate parts of the animal
body, we shall only be able to form a true
conception of the motive agencies of the whole
complicated machine, when we have established
the specific excitability of the end apparatus
of every centripetal nerve, and have discovered
all the mechanical, chemical, and other factors
which throw this or that end apparatus into an
active condition. I always look upon it as a
period of scientific inadequacy so long as the
effects of the most diverse external agencies
upon any normal physiological process are
admitted to be indistinguishable. As the work
of the digestive canal is now represented in the
majority of text-books, and consequently presented
to the mind of the physician, it bears the
impress of this period. To impart to the physician
a more correct conception of this matter
was my chief object in giving these lectures.
I hope, indeed, to furnish you with evidence
sufficiently convincing, that the alimentary canal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
is endowed not with mere general excitability;
that is to say, does not respond to every conceivable
form of agency, but only to special
conditions which are different for the different
portions of its length. Just as men and animals
in the world are only able to maintain their
existence and constantly adapt themselves to
changing circumstances by aid of the peripheral
endings of their sensory nerves, so every organ,
indeed every cell of every organ, can only maintain
its place in the animal microcosm, and
adapt itself to the activity of innumerable associates,
as well as to the general life of the whole,
by virtue of the fact that the peripheral end
apparatus of its centripetal nerves possesses a
specific excitability.</p>

<p>The same applies to the nerve cells: obviously
they are endowed with specific sensibility.
Irrespective of the excitations which are communicated
to them from centripetal nerves, they
respond, as originators of nervous impulses,
only or at least mainly to definite forms of
mechanical, chemical, or other stimuli arising
in the organism. This follows not alone from a
number of physiological facts but also from
various pharmacological data. Thus we learn
that various drugs excite or annul the activity
of definite portions of the nervous system, at
least in the earlier phases of their effects. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
specific excitability of nerve cells, just as much
as the same property of peripheral end organs,
lies at the bottom of the purposive action of
these organs.</p>

<p>Hence, our next duty is to endeavour to
discover the normal exciting conditions of the
centripetal nerves belonging to the glands which
we had under consideration in our last lecture,
or, more correctly, to find out the conditions
which excite the centres, as well as the peripheral
endings of the different nerves, which
form parts of the nervous apparatus of these
glands. We have, therefore, for each phase of
the work of secretion, to find out that portion
of the nervous mechanism which is for the time
being under excitation, and to discover the
primary agency by which this condition is
elicited. This would include an exact analysis
of the stimulating influence which mastication
and food exert upon the nervous mechanism of
these glands. We shall also be able more fully
to comprehend the inner mechanism underlying
the facts which formed the subject of the second
lecture. This, of course, is an ideal programme
which we can only follow out as far as the present
state of physiology permits. It may now
be instructive, and, for our further conclusions,
advantageous, to glance shortly at the nervous
control of the salivary glands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>The salivary glands, whose innervation has
long ago been investigated, have generally been
accepted as types of the deeper-lying digestive
glands, and when it became necessary to form a
conception of the mode of activity of the latter,
medical science resorted to a bold analogy and
thought of the nervous apparatus of the salivary
glands. But the attempts of investigators to
apply rigidly to others the scheme of innervation
which holds good for the salivary glands, have
done considerable harm to the usefulness of the
analogy and have prevented our arriving at a
correct idea of the plan of innervation of the
abdominal glands. We have already had an example
of this nature before us. In the salivary
glands we have no clearly marked indications of
nervous inhibition, and this circumstance has
decidedly retarded the due development of our
knowledge of the nervous control of the abdominal
glands. Authors naturally expected to
see a simple and prompt stimulation-effect
from the same conditions of experiment which
sufficed for the salivary glands, and the failure
of this gave them, as they thought, the right
to deny the existence of any extrinsic nervous
influence upon the abdominal glands. The
error is now obvious; the abdominal glands
behave in some ways different from the salivary
glands, and for their successful investigation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
other conditions of experiment are necessary
than those which held good for the former. In
the working of the abdominal glands nervous
inhibitory processes play a large part, but they
are almost wholly absent in the case of the
salivary glands. This is an additional warning
that one must never push the conclusions drawn
from analogy too far, but must constantly bear
in mind that the life-functions of all organs are
extremely complicated, and that the work of
even the most apparently similar organs should
be submitted to separate and careful observation.
To me it appears that the unjustified analogy
drawn between the abdominal and salivary
glands has to be credited with another important
misapprehension. And precisely for this
reason I think it desirable to bring under consideration,
if only in brief fashion, the conditions
of work of the salivary glands, especially since
Dr. Glinski has instituted in the laboratory some
easily performed experiments which bear upon
the matter.</p>

<p>The experiences of daily life teach us from
the outset, that the activity of the salivary glands
begins even before the introduction of food into
the mouth. With an empty stomach, the sight
of food or even the thought of it is sufficient to
set the salivary glands at once into activity;
indeed, the well-known expression, “to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
one’s mouth water,” is based upon this fact.
Hence a psychic event, the eager longing for
food, must be accepted as an undoubted excitant
of the nervous centre for the salivary glands.
On the other hand, the same every-day experience,
as well as numerous experiments upon
animals, teach us that a number of substances,
when brought into contact with the mucous
membrane of the mouth, are likewise able to
call forth a secretion of saliva. One even
acquires the impression that everything brought
into the mouth may reflexly influence these
glands, the only difference being a gradual shading
off in the effect, dependent upon the strength
of the stimulation which the substance introduced
is able to exert, and it appears to me that it is
precisely this impression which has driven the
idea into the background, that the peripheral
end apparatus of the centripetal nerves of the
digestive canal are specifically excitable. The
facts were here correctly observed, but their
indications erroneously interpreted.</p>

<p>The great multiplicity of excitants of salivary
secretion, has without doubt, some connection
with the complicated physiological functions of
the saliva. This is the first fluid encountered
by everything which enters the alimentary canal.
It must, therefore, in a sense play the part of
host to every substance taken in&mdash;moisten the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
dry, dissolve the soluble, envelop the hard and
bulky with mucus in order to facilitate its passage
down the narrow œsophagus; and submit
certain forms of food material, such as starch, to
a process of chemical elaboration. Nor is its
duty by any means ended here. The saliva is
secreted in the first compartment of the alimentary
canal, which is at the same time the sorting-room
of the organism. Much of what enters
the mouth may prove in the testing process to
be useless, or even noxious, and must either
have its deleterious properties neutralised or be
completely rejected. The saliva is secreted in
the first instance to obviate injurious effects in
some way; thus, for example, a strong acid is to
a certain degree neutralised, while other corroding
substances may be simply diluted, and by
mere reduction of concentration have their
harmfulness diminished.</p>

<p>In the second place, when the injurious substances
have to be wholly removed, the saliva
plays the <i>rôle</i> of a washing-out fluid; otherwise
the material, by clinging to the mucous membrane
of the mouth, might in longer or shorter
time gain entry into the blood and there develop
its noxious influence. This last function of the
fluid is hardly taken into account at all in
physiology, and yet it is evident that the saliva,
as a cleansing fluid, must have a wide importance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
If you only think of how often we are impelled
to expectorate, that is, to wash out the mouth
with saliva after something unpleasant, this will
be clear. Such a view finds additional support
when we reflect that a feeling of disgust produces
almost as strong a flow of saliva as the
sight of a tasty meal. In both cases the secretion
performs the office of forerunner: in the
first it prepares for the washing out of the
mouth, in the second for the requisite elaboration
of the food. Think how often, when something
disagreeable enters the mouth, with what
rapidity the saliva is poured out, even after the
unpleasant substance has been for a considerable
time removed, and not a trace more is apparent
to the sense of taste. Indeed, long afterwards
one has only to recall the circumstances to
mind in order to bring on anew the secretion of
saliva. Apparently the psychic excitation of the
nerves of salivary secretion also ushers in the
act of vomiting, which, as is well known, can be
called forth by mental influence. Further, the
function of the saliva just mentioned is probably
the true physiological explanation of the feeling
of disgust which many persons experience at
the sight of the secretion itself.</p>

<p>Hence I hold that substances which obtain
entry to the mouth set up a secretion of saliva
only because we have here the seat of a defi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>nite
physiological sense, and not because the
peripheral terminations of the buccal nerves
are devoid of specific excitability, and capable
of being thrown into action by every desired
form of stimulus. In other words, the specific
excitability of the peripheral endings of the
salivary nerves is very comprehensive and
widely extended. This is no picture of the
imagination, for it can be supported by facts.
To say nothing of the testimony of earlier authors,
that the salivary glands have each particular
exciting agencies to which they specially
respond, we can demonstrate the following facts
from the material collected in our laboratory.</p>

<p>Dr. Glinski isolated the orifices of the salivary
glands in dogs with portions of the adjoining
mucous membrane, brought them out of the oral
cavity, and caused them to heal into the edges of
the skin wounds. In his first animal the ducts of
the submaxillary gland were thus led outwards.
By means of a Mendeljeff’s clip, the wide end
of a conical funnel of waterproof material was
attached to the skin surrounding the orifice.
To the narrow end a small test-tube, which
served to collect the saliva, was attached by a
wire. I now offer such an animal a piece of
flesh, and, as you see, the tube fills up at once
with saliva. I stop tempting the dog, hang on
a new test-tube, and give it a few pieces of flesh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
to eat; once more a strong secretion of saliva
results. A new tube is now attached to the
funnel, the dog’s mouth is opened, and a pinch
of fine sand thrown in; again there is a flow of
saliva. Once more a new test-tube; and now
I apply to the buccal mucous membrane, the
plume of a feather dipped in acid solution, with
the result that I obtain a strong flow of saliva.
One may employ a number of substances in this
way, when a similar effect is always produced.
You see, in this, such a comprehensive excitability
of the innervation apparatus of the salivary
glands that you might readily interpret it as
meaning the power of response to all and sundry
forms of stimulation. We now proceed, however,
to another dog, whose parotid duct has in
a similar manner been diverted outwards. The
saliva is collected in the same way. We tempt
the dog with a piece of flesh, but to our
astonishment no saliva flows, and yet the animal
is most eager for the savoury meal offered. Now
we give it some raw flesh to eat; again the
secretion of saliva is as good as absent; only
when I come near can I detect one or two drops
of saliva running down the sides of the tube.
Probably you will say there is something wrong,
either with the method or with the glands of the
animal. But wait a little. I now give the dog
finely powdered dry flesh, and obtain at once an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
abundant secretion. Should any one happen to
think that the variation in the result is dependent,
not on a different specific activity of the
glands, but on individual differences in the dogs,
I respond that Dr. Glinski has had an animal
with double parotid and submaxillary fistulæ,
and was able to observe on one and the same
dog, a like behaviour on the part of the glands
to that which we have just seen in two different
individuals. An analogous experiment with
bread was also carried out by Dr. Glinski.
The eating of fresh moist bread produced no
secretion worth mentioning, while dry bread, on
the other hand, caused the saliva to flow in
large quantities. The results of this experiment
permit us to draw extremely instructive conclusions.
In the first place, the several salivary
glands are, as a matter of fact, very sharply
differentiated in the conditions necessary for
their activity&mdash;that is to say, in respect to the
agencies which excite their nervous mechanisms.
Secondly, the innervation apparatus of the parotid
manifests a very sharp selective power in
the choice, so to speak, of an adequate stimulus.
The mechanical effect of large pieces of flesh is
naturally much greater than that of the finely
powdered material, and yet it was precisely to the
latter that the glands responded. The stimulus
is, therefore, not due to the mechanical, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
some other property of the food. This other
property is obviously the dryness of the
material. Our example illustrates how that
which we may term “purposiveness” comes
into play in the working of our glands and also
how erroneous is the opinion that the mechanical
stimulus is all potent. Indeed, previous
authors have already pointed out that dry substances
cause a specially free secretion of saliva,
and yet physiological opinion throughout the
length and breadth of the land, as expressed in
text-books, has chosen to recognise a <i>universal</i>
instead of a <i>specific</i> excitability. Dr. Wulfson,
who is at present carrying on the investigation
of salivary secretion in our laboratory, has added
a very interesting observation to the results of
Dr. Glinski already related. The parotid gland,
which is hardly, if at all, excited when one offers
fresh meat to the animal, responds with a very
active secretion, when dry food (bread or powdered
meat) is offered. This phenomenon is
all the more surprising since the desire of the
animal for eating is much more strongly excited
by flesh than by dry bread. I am quite convinced
that an exact study of the exciting
agencies of the three salivary glands will furnish
a number of new data bearing upon the question
in hand.</p>

<p>The second reagent which is poured out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
the raw material in the digestive canal is the
gastric juice. How, in the normal course of
events, is the work of the gastric glands, which
prepare this juice, called into play? With the
first, and manifestly important factor, which has
a relation thereto, you are already acquainted,
and, indeed, have already seen. I refer to the
production of gastric juice in the empty stomach,
as a result merely of the swallowing of food in
the so-called sham feeding of an œsophagotomised
dog. When one takes into consideration
the absolute independence of this factor, and
the intensity of the effect, which makes itself
evident in the secretion of a large quantity of
juice of high digestive power, the exciting agency
which brings about such secretion must be recognised
as one of the most important and effective
processes in gastric digestion. But in what does
it consist? At first sight it appears&mdash;and when
I previously drew your attention to the fact I
expressed the opinion&mdash;that there is here a
simple reflex effect from the cavity of the mouth
upon the secretory nerves of the stomach, similar
to the reflex excitation, <i>e.g.</i>, of the parotid gland,
by finely powdered flesh thrown into the mouth.
Now, however, I assert quite emphatically that
this is not the case. We have, it is true, in the
activity of the salivary glands an analogous
phenomenon to indicate&mdash;not, however, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
of which we have just spoken. We might apply
every conceivable form of stimulus which
could possibly come into play in the act of eating,
and yet would not obtain the slightest indication
of secretory activity in the stomach. In
this dog with a gastric fistula, and with also
a divided œsophagus, I will try such an experiment,
using the most effective chemical stimulus
to the buccal mucous membrane, viz., acid
solution.</p>

<p>The secretion of saliva begins at once, as you
see; the acid is, therefore, effective. From the
stomach, however, in spite of continued excitation,
no secretion results, although the acid,
mixed with the saliva, is swallowed and flows out
again from the upper segment of the œsophagus&mdash;that
is to say, passes along precisely the same
path that the food takes in sham feeding.</p>

<p>We could experiment in the same way with
a number of other substances: saline, bitters,
pepper (strong local excitation), mustard, and
so on, and always with the same results; a free
secretion of saliva, but perfect quiescence of the
gastric glands. We may even, with the same
object, employ the soluble constituents of flesh
in the form of a decoction, and likewise observe,
in most cases at least, no sign of activity on the
part of the gastric glands.</p>

<p>With the chemical we may also combine a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
mechanical stimulus. We can, for example,
wipe out the mouth with a sponge soaked in
the solution to be experimented with, but always
with the same negative result. We may finally
give such pieces of sponge, or even smooth
stones of considerable size, to the dog to swallow,
passing them back behind the anterior
pillars of the fauces and allowing them to fall
out again, from the upper portion of œsophagus.
It may be added that a well-taught dog puts up
with all these procedures without the slightest
protest. You see that all the manipulations in
this case are carried out with bare hands and without
instrumental aid. One can easily train a dog
to swallow stones which are placed in the anterior
part of the buccal cavity. It simply makes a
few chewing movements and swallows them
down. The dog on which the acid experiment
has just been made serves also for the swallowing
of the stones. The attendant now places
some pebbles in the front part of the mouth,
when the animal rolls them round, as if chewing
and gnawing them, and then swallows them.
The stones fall out, as you see, from the œsophagus,
and drop with an audible sound upon the
table. This play with the stones has now lasted
fifteen or twenty minutes (in the laboratory we
have often kept it up for hours), and yet not a
drop of gastric juice is to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>In order to prove that the dog is perfectly
healthy and normal, we lay aside the stones and
proceed to our old experiment of sham feeding.
As you see, the first drop of gastric juice makes
its appearance precisely at the end of five minutes,
and after a further five minutes we have
collected more than 15 c.c. of the fluid; consequently
there can be no doubt that in this dog
both gastric glands and nerves are uninjured
and function in normal manner. At one time
we even had a dog which voluntarily took the
stones out of one’s hand and swallowed them;
the sagacious creature had seen our object in
previous experiments and learned to perform it
of its own accord! But in this case also the
result was negative.</p>

<p>Clearly, therefore, neither chemical nor mechanical
stimulation of the buccal mucous membrane
is capable of reflexly exciting the nerves
of the stomach. Further, it is obvious that the
excitation of these nerves in sham feeding is
not the result of a stimulation coincidently produced;
that is to say, the excitement of the
chewing and swallowing centres does not imply
simultaneous action of the secretory centre of
the gastric glands. In what, then, does this
influence consist which is intrinsic to the sham
feeding, but which we have not been able to reproduce
in our analytical investigation? There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
is only one thing to think of, namely, the eager
desire for food, and the feeling of satisfaction
and contentment derived from its enjoyment.</p>

<p>It has, indeed, been known for forty years,
thanks to the experiments of Bidder and
Schmidt, that at times, the offering of food to
a hungry dog, in other words, the excitement
of a keen desire for it, is sufficient to cause a
flow of gastric juice from the empty stomach.
We shall presently have occasion to observe
the force of this physiological factor. Here I
bring before you another dog, likewise having
a gastric fistula with divided œsophagus. The
stomach has been washed out half an hour ago,
and since then not a drop of gastric juice has
escaped. We begin to get ready a meal of flesh
and sausage before the animal as if we meant to
feed it. We take the pieces of flesh from one
place, chop them up, and lay them in another,
passing them in front of the dog’s nose, and so
on. The animal, as you see, manifests the liveliest
interest in our proceedings, stretches and
distends itself, endeavours to get out of its cage
and come to the food, chatters its teeth together,
swallows saliva, and so on. Precisely five minutes
after we began to tease the animal in this
way the first drops of gastric juice appear in
the fistula The secretion grows ever stronger
and stronger, till it flows in a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
stream. After the lapse of a few minutes we
can count the number of cubic centimetres by
tens. The meaning of this experiment is so
clear as to require no explanation; the passionate
longing for food, and this alone, has called
forth under our eyes a most intense activity of
the gastric glands. If the experiment be frequently
repeated, one can easily observe that
the keener and more eager the desire on the
part of the dog for the food, the more certain
and intense is the secretory effect. In extreme
cases there is even a quantitative relationship
between this effect and that of the sham feeding.</p>

<p>Here is an experiment of Professor Ssanozki,
in which the secretory effect of the mere tempting
of the animal with the sight of food is compared
with that of sham feeding. A few threads
of alkaline mucus had just escaped from the
stomach, and then the excitation of the dog
with flesh was begun. After six minutes the
secretion commenced and continued as follows:</p>

<p>It is clear that in this case the tempting,
instead of being less effective than the sham
feeding, on the contrary excelled it.</p>

<p>Consequently, the observation of Bidder and
Schmidt was perfectly correct. It cannot, however,
be said that it received general recognition
in physiology, or that it was sufficiently appreciated.
There are authors who could never
convince themselves of its reality, and in many
physiological text-books it is not once mentioned.
By way of explanation, we shall now
consider how this matter must be dealt with by
those who wish to observe the effect. It is only
under certain conditions that it can be seen.
Firstly, the animal must be healthy and vigorous;
it must have a perfectly uninjured gastric
mucous membrane; and this, from the description
in the case of many authors who obtained
a negative result, was not the case. Secondly,
the success of the experiment, as stated above,
is dependent upon the intensity of the desire
for eating, and this, again, is dependent upon
how freely and how long beforehand the dog
had eaten, and also upon what it is tempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
with, whether with a dish that excites its desire
or leaves its interest unawakened. It is known
that dogs have very different tastes, just as men
have. Thirdly, one may find among the dogs
positively careless, indifferent creatures, incapable
of being perturbed in this way by anything
which has not actually reached their mouths,
and patiently waiting till the food is given them.
Hence for success in the experiment, eager,
impressionable, and excitable animals are necessary.
Fourthly, one has to reckon with the
sense and cunning of the dog, a factor which is
not lightly to be disregarded. Often the animals
perceive at once that they are only being
teased with the food, become annoyed thereat,
and turn away offended at what is being done
before them. We must, therefore, so arrange
matters as if the animals were not going to be
disappointed but fed in reality. If attention
be paid to these conditions the experiment of
“psychic excitation of the gastric secretion,” as
we usually term it, will be found to be as reliable
as the experiment of sham feeding. When one
is occupied for a length of time with the study
of the gastric secretion under different conditions,
one becomes convinced of what a dangerous
source of error this psychic excitability
may become in the different experiments. We
must constantly fight, so to speak, against this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
factor, keep it ever in view, and guard against it.
If the dog has not eaten for a long time, every
movement,&mdash;the going out of the room, the appearance
of the attendant who ordinarily feeds the
animal&mdash;in word, every little triviality may give
rise to excitation of the gastric glands. The minutest
attention is necessary in order to avoid such
sources of error, and we should not be far wrong
if we said that much which has been ascribed in
former investigations to the effect of this or that
agency was in reality a result of unobserved
psychic influence. Consequently, in order to
verify our own conclusions concerning the effects
of this or that condition, we have performed many
of our experiments on sleeping animals, having
beforehand convinced ourselves by frequent repetition
that sleep exercises no restraining influence
on the working of the gastric glands.</p>

<p>When we recall to mind the failure of our
attempts to obtain a secretion of gastric juice
by any stimulation whatever of the buccal mucous
membrane, and at the same time see how
constant and intense the action of this psychic
impression is, we are forced to the inevitable
conclusion that in our sham feeding experiment
the whole secretory effect is due to the psychic
stimulus, that is to say, to the keen desire on
the part of the animal for food and the satisfaction
of enjoying it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>In view of the importance of the act of eating,
which even now is apparent, but which will
become still more obvious when the succeeding
periods of secretion are investigated, we have
spared neither time nor trouble to arrive at a
correct explanation of the mechanism of this
factor. We have, therefore, taken in hand a
number of modifications of the sham feeding
experiment, and these investigations have confirmed
the opinion at which we had arrived.
If, for instance, the dog has been prepared by
a long fast of two to three days, a very intense
secretion of gastric juice will always be obtained
by the sham feeding experiment, no matter
what may be given it to eat, whether boiled or
raw flesh, bread or coagulated egg-white, etc.
The dog, however, which has not fasted, that is
to say has been fed fifteen to twenty hours before,
will pick and choose amongst the different
foods, eating one with great greed, tolerating another,
and refusing altogether a third, and, corresponding
therewith, the amount and quality
of the gastric juice will manifest wide variations.
The more eagerly the dog eats the more juice
will be secreted and the greater the digestive
power which it possesses. The majority of dogs
prefer flesh to bread, and correspondingly less
juice will be produced by sham feeding with
bread than with flesh. Sometimes, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
we find dogs which will devour bread with
greater appetite than flesh. In these cases one
obtains more and stronger juice in sham feeding
with bread than with flesh. Here is a case in
point: a dog is given boiled meat which has
been cut into pieces of definite size, and the
pieces follow each other at regular intervals of
time. The animal eats, but soon, from its behaviour,
you see that it develops no particular
greed for the meal, and this observation is confirmed
by the fact that after fifteen to twenty
minutes it ceases taking the flesh. The secretion
of juice has meanwhile either not begun at
all, or only after a longer interval than five
minutes, and remains scanty to the end. Now
wait till the secretion has stopped and give the
same dog raw flesh, either forthwith or next
day, in pieces of the same size and at the same
rate as before. The raw meat tastes excellently
to the dog; it eats for hours at a time; the secretion
of gastric juice begins precisely after five
minutes and is very active. With another dog
which prefers boiled to raw meat exactly the
reverse occurs. Broth, soup, milk&mdash;towards
which dogs are usually more indifferent than
towards solid food&mdash;often produce in sham
feeding either no secretion at all or only very
little, although broth, for instance has essentially
the same taste as flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>It is therefore clear that in sham feeding the
psychic effect may readily become an absolute
and independent factor. All the conditions
which we enumerated above, and which are
necessary for the successful production of the
psychic effect, hold good in combined form for
the sham feeding experiment. The dog eats
with greed before one’s eyes; the food which it
receives is pleasant; it not only imagines food
but actually eats it, and has therefore no reason
to feel offended, for naturally the idea does not
occur to any of the dogs that all their trouble is
in vain.</p>

<p>Consequently, in the sham feeding experiment,
by the act of eating, the excitation of
the nerves of the gastric glands depends upon
a psychical factor which has here grown into a
physiological one, that is to say, is just as much
a matter of course, and appears quite as regularly
under given conditions as any other physiological
result. Regarded from the purely physiological
side, the process may be said to be a
complicated reflex act. Its complexity arises
from this, that the ultimate object is attained by
the joint working of many separate organic
functions. The material to be digested&mdash;the
food&mdash;is only found outside the organism in
the surrounding world. It is acquired not alone
by the exercise of muscular force, but also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
by the intervention of higher functions, such as
judgment, will, desire. Hence the simultaneous
excitation of the different sense organs, of sight,
of hearing, of smell and taste, is the first and
strongest impulse towards the activity of the
gastric glands. This especially applies to the
two latter senses, since they are only excited
when the food has already entered the organism,
or at least has arrived very near it. It is by the
establishment of this passionate desire for eating
that unerring and untiring nature has linked the
seeking and finding of food with the commencement
of the work of digestion. That this factor,
which we have now carefully analysed,
stands in closest connection with an every-day
phenomenon of human life, namely, appetite,
may easily be predicated. This agency, which
is so important to life and so full of mystery to
science, becomes here at length incorporated
into flesh and blood, transformed from a subjective
sensation into a concrete factor of the
physiological laboratory.</p>

<p>We are therefore justified in saying that the
appetite is the first and mightiest exciter of the
secretory nerves of the stomach, a factor which
embodies in itself a something capable of impelling
the empty stomach of the dog in the sham
feeding experiment to secrete large quantities
of the strongest juice. A good appetite in eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>ing
is equivalent from the outset to a vigorous
secretion of the strongest juice; where there is
no appetite this juice is also absent. To restore
appetite to a man means to secure him a large
stock of gastric juice wherewith to begin the
digestion of the meal.</p>

ourselves acquainted with the first normal impulse
which, in the natural course of events,
calls into activity the innervation apparatus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>

one, and consists in a passionate longing for
food, that which in every-day life, and in the
practice of the physician, is called “appetite,”
and which everybody, both medical and lay,
endeavours carefully to promote. We may
now venture to say explicitly, <span class="allsmcap">APPETITE IS

importance of the sensation. Medical
science endeavours to assist the debilitated
stomach by introducing the active constituent
of gastric juice&mdash;pepsin&mdash;from without, or by
prescribing other remedies believed to promote
its secretion. It is, however, of interest to follow
our experimental investigation still farther.
What position is to be assigned to the “psychic”
or “appetite-juice”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in the course of normal
gastric digestion? Is any definite <i>rôle</i> to be
attributed to it? What course does gastric
digestion take when it is absent? Fortunately
to all these important questions satisfactory
answers are forthcoming by experiment. We
have only to regret that these answers come
so late.</p>

<p>Let us recall to memory how the secretion
of gastric juice proceeded after feeding with
flesh or bread in the case of our dog with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
isolated miniature stomach. The following are
the quantities and digestive capabilities of the
first two hourly portions of juice after the administration
of 200 grams of flesh or bread
(experiments by Dr. Chigin):</p>

<p>You see at once that the secretion of the
first hour is identical in the two cases both as
regards quantity and digestive power, and only
in the second is the secretory work differentiated
according to the nature of the food. How are
we to explain the secretion which takes place
at the commencement? Is it not the same
which we have already seen in the sham feeding
experiments? Is not this first onrush of the
stream of secretion the preliminary psychic
juice? Unquestionably, gentlemen, this is the
case, and we may convince ourselves of the fact
in the most diverse ways. Above all, the following
is clear: whatever occurs in the so-called
sham feeding cannot wholly be absent in the
case of normal feeding, since the former is
nothing else than the isolated commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
of normal digestion. This justifiable inference
is fully confirmed, if the secretion of the first
hours after the administration of flesh and bread
be compared with that after simple sham feeding.
In the case of feeding with flesh and bread,
the identically similar and high digestive power
of the first hourly portions is striking, and this
power coincides with what we have met in sham
feeding. Further, if the quantity of juice from
the miniature stomach during the first hour
be compared with that produced by the non-resected
part of the organ,&mdash;to do which we
must multiply it by ten, since the resected <i>cul-de-sac</i>
is approximately one-tenth of the whole
organ,&mdash;it is here again found that the quantity
approximately corresponds to the mean values
obtained by sham feeding. Finally, the depression
in digestive power or quantity of juice
(with flesh, decrease of digestive power; with
bread, decline in the quantity of juice), which
sets in soon after the taking of food, indicates
that the two conditions are connected with the
ingestion of food&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, with a transitory factor
which soon passes away and gives place to other
conditions. Our explanation becomes still more
convincing when we take into consideration the
effects of other foods. If you give the dog, for
example, something else to eat which does not
interest it to the same degree as flesh or bread,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
you will find the initial increase in quantity and
strength of juice does not appear. Offer the
animal milk, for example, which in sham feeding,
especially if it does not last long, calls
forth, as a rule, no secretion, or at all events
only very little, and the rapid flow of the commencement&mdash;the
already-mentioned initial rise&mdash;absolutely
fails to appear. You have already
seen the figures which deal with this matter;
I think it necessary, however, to bring them
forward again in order that you may be better
able to compare them with the secretion after
flesh and bread.</p>

<p>We have now begun the analytical examination
of the variations of our secretory curve.
But owing to the importance of the matter we
did not confine ourselves to conclusions which
might be drawn from earlier investigations.
We turned to new forms of experiment for
further proof.</p>

<p>Thus we divided the ordinary ration of flesh

were able to detect a rise both in the quantity
and in the digestive power of the juice. The

<p>In the curve which follows, only the variations

<p>It is clear that the increase, both of digestive
power and of juice volume, is connected with
the act of taking in food.</p>

<p>It appeared of interest definitely to determine
the volume and properties of the secretion
called forth by the act of eating in the dog with
the isolated stomach. We endeavoured, therefore,
at the beginning, to imitate the conditions
of sham feeding as they occurred in the case of
the dog with divided œsophagus. In addition
to the fistular orifice leading into the isolated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
miniature stomach, another was opened into the
main portion of the organ. If we now fed the
dog in the ordinary way with small pieces of
flesh, these were received back again at the
orifice of the latter fistula, covered with saliva.
Precisely as in
sham feeding,
after five minutes
the juice
began to flow
simultaneously,
from both the
large and small
stomachs. The
secretion ran a
corresponding
course in the
two cavities and
ceased at the
same length of
time in both after the administration of food was
stopped. Here is an instance taken from such
an experiment performed by Dr. Lobassoff.</p>

<p>In five minutes the dog had eaten eighty
pieces of flesh (weighing 172 grams), all of
which soon afterwards dropped out at the fistula.
The secretion began in both stomachs after the
lapse of seven minutes from the commencement
of the feeding, and proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>The secretion from both cavities also came to
an end at the same time.</p>

<p>This experiment proves to us, first, that the
main and miniature stomachs work in perfectly
parallel manner with each other. The beginning,
the end, and the intermediate variations of
the secretion correspond in both cases. Secondly,
the digestive power of the secretion
coincides in both, and is the same which was
observed in the so-called sham feeding. It has
here remained at the same height till the cessation
of the secretion, without falling to the
lower value which we observed from the beginning
of the second hour onwards, after normal
flesh feeding.</p>

<p>This was also confirmed later, when we
performed an œsophagotomy on the dog, and
carried out sham feeding in typical form. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
follows one of these experiments taken from
Dr. Lobassoff’s article.</p>

<p>The first drop of juice appeared from both
cavities during the sixth minute after commencing
the feeding, which was kept up for half an
hour. The further course of the secretion was

<p>The secretion came to an end in both
stomachs at the same time.</p>

<p>The above is represented in curves in Figs.
2 and 3, the scale on which that for the main
stomach is drawn being ten times less than that
for the small. As you see, the progress of
secretion is identical in both.</p>

<p>The existence of a fistula leading into the
large stomach affords us also the possibility of
performing an experiment upon our dog which
is exactly the converse of the sham feeding
experiment, and which constitutes a real <i>experimentum
crucis</i>. While in sham feeding, we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
only, so to speak, the beginning of digestion
before us, we are now able in our cross experiment
to start at the continuation of this beginning.
For this purpose it is only necessary to
bring the food into the stomach through the
fistula, without attracting the dog’s attention.
Since in this experiment it is above all necessary
not to excite the dog’s appetite, it is best to
carry out the procedure on the sleeping animal.
I may add at once, however, that the same
result can be obtained on the waking animal,
only the process must be performed unnoticed,
and the animal’s attention must be diverted from
thoughts of food.</p>

<p>The results of this experiment are striking,
and do not in any way resemble the secretion
after normal feeding. Some kinds of food, for
instance bread and coagulated white of the hen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
egg, when directly introduced into the stomach,
do not yield a single drop of juice during the
first hour or more afterwards. This holds good
both for the small and large stomachs. When
a glass rod is introduced into the food contained
in the organ it remains dry. Flesh, if introduced
at this stage, is able to excite a secretion, but
the appearance of the juice is considerably
retarded. It begins from fifteen to forty-five
minutes after the feeding, instead of from six
to ten, is under normal circumstances extremely
scanty during the first hour (3 c.c. to 5 c.c. instead
of 12 c.c. to 15 c.c.), and possesses a
very low digestive power.</p>

<p>The progress of juice secretion in the above

flesh). C. Sham feeding with same. D. Summation of B and C.</div>
</div>

<p>As you see, the curve which represents the
results of the direct introduction of flesh ascends
much more slowly and does not attain anything
like the height of that caused by normal feeding
with the same food. But if the quantities
obtained by direct introduction of the flesh be
added to those of sham feeding, the resulting
curve is almost identical with the normal.</p>

<p>In like manner the digestive power of the
secretion in the foregoing experiments can be
dealt with, and with the same result. It is a
good instance of how a secretion curve can be
synthetically constructed from its constituent
factors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Finally, I am able to demonstrate to you
the following instructive experiment. In the
presence of some of my listeners, whom I had
invited to attend an hour before the lecture, I
carried out the following procedures on two dogs,
both of which had ordinary gastric fistulæ and
were, besides, œsophagotomised. Into the stomach
of one, while its attention was distracted by
patting and speaking kindly to it in order to
avoid arousing any thoughts of feeding, a definite
number of pieces of flesh were introduced
through the fistula. The morsels were threaded
on a string, the free end of which was fastened
to the fistular cannula by inserting a cork. The
dog was then brought into a separate room and
left to itself. A like number of pieces was introduced
into the stomach of the other dog in the
same way, but during the process a vigorous
sham feeding was kept up, the animal being
afterwards left alone. Each dog received 100
grams of flesh. Since then an hour and a half
have elapsed, and now we may draw the pieces
of flesh out by means of the thread and weigh
them. The loss of weight, and consequently the
amount of flesh digested, is very different in the
two cases. In that of the dog without sham
feeding the loss of weight amounts to merely 6
grams, while the flesh withdrawn from the stomach
of the other dog weighs only 70 grams, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
is to say, was reduced by 30 grams. This, therefore,
represents the digestive value of the passage
of food through the mouth, the value of an
eager desire for food, the value of an appetite.</p>

<p>I give also a series of figures obtained by
Dr. Lobassoff in analogous experiments. Into
the dog’s stomach 25 pieces of flesh (100 grams)
were brought. The flesh remained two hours
in the cavity. Without sham feeding 6.5 per
cent, with eight minutes’ sham feeding 31.6 per
cent, of the quantity was digested.</p>

<p>Again: the flesh remained an hour and a
half in the stomach; without sham feeding 5.6
per cent, with five minutes’ sham feeding 15
per cent, was digested.</p>

<p>Once more: the flesh remained five hours
in the stomach; without sham feeding 58 per
cent, with sham feeding 85 per cent, was digested,
the balance of undigested food being 42
per cent in the one case and 15 per cent in the
other.</p>

<p>I must, however, add that from the nature
of this experiment it is not well adapted for
class demonstration, and may often fail. On the
one hand, it is not at all easy to conceal the
introduction of the flesh from the dog; on
the other, the unusual and distracting surroundings
of the animal often causes a short period
of sham feeding to have less effect than would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
otherwise pertain. In order to avoid such failures
it is better before an audience to carry
out this experiment only on dogs accustomed
to appear in the lecture theatre, and of whose
temperament the experimenter is well assured.</p>

<p>I hope you have now been convinced of the
great importance which is to be attached to the
passage of food through the mouth and œsophagus,
or, in other words&mdash;and this, according to
our former experiences, means the same thing&mdash;to
the eager desire for food. Without this
longing, without the assistance of appetite,
many forms of food-stuffs which gain entry to
the stomach remain wholly devoid of gastric
juice. Others, it is true, excite a secretion, but
the juice poured out is scanty and weak.</p>

<p>It is only later, when we have still more
fully recognised the conditions upon which the
secretory work of the gastric glands depends,
that we shall be able to grasp the meaning of
these facts in a more comprehensive manner.
For instance, why does bread brought unnoticed
into the stomach of the dog cause no secretion
for hours, while flesh tolerably soon (after
twenty to forty minutes) provokes this act?
This will be explained in the next lecture; now,
however, we must consider other questions.</p>

<p>How long does the after-effect, the echo of
the first impulse to the secretory nerves of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
stomach, continue to last? How long does appetite
juice continue to flow after the normal act
of eating, which, especially in the case of animals,
is not of long duration? We have already
determined many times, not only on our dog
with the isolated stomach, but also on other animals,
how long the after-effect of sham feeding
is continued.</p>

<p>Here, for example, is an experiment from
the article of Professor Ssanozki which deals
with the point. The dog had a gastric fistula
and also an opening leading into the œsophagus.
After a sham feeding of five minutes the
secretion began, and was continued as follows:</p>

<p>The effect, therefore, even after a short
period of sham feeding, stretches over a length
of time. Naturally the same holds good for the
taking of food in the normal way. One must,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
however, bear in mind that in sham feeding,
with all the force and reality of a hunger sensation
not satisfied, the eager desire for food,
the effective agency, becomes more and more
accentuated, and therefore the secretory influence
is prolonged and more powerful. In
normal feeding, however, the quelling of the
longing, the feeling of satisfaction which, as is
well known, sets in long before the termination
of the digestive period from the mere filling and
distension of the stomach, must diminish the
desire for food, and, consequently, bring the
secretory effect to an end.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, improbable that the whole
secretory process in the stomach, which, in the
case of certain kinds and quantities of food,
lasts from ten to twelve hours, is dependent on
the factors which we have up to the present
investigated. This is all the more obvious since
a sham feeding of five minutes, even under the
most favourable circumstances, does not call
forth a secretion for longer than three to four
hours. We must, therefore, seek for other exciting
agencies of the innervation apparatus of
the gastric glands.</p>

<p>Why and wherefore is the secretion instituted
by psychic influence maintained? What
would first occur to all your minds is naturally
the immediate influence which the food exerts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
upon the walls of the stomach. And this is
true, but it does not happen in the simple, direct
fashion current in the minds of many physiologists
and physicians. When I said that bread
or boiled white of egg, introduced directly into
the stomach, may not for hours produce a trace
of secretion, probably many of my hearers may
have asked themselves with natural astonishment,
“How, then, is the effect of the forced
feeding of phthisical and insane patients, and
the artificial feeding of those with gastric fistulæ
(performed on account of stricture of the
œsophagus) to be explained?” I will introduce
my answer by a very unexpected pronouncement
relative to the assertion that mechanical
stimulation of the stomach wall by food constitutes
a reliable and effective means of calling
forth the secretory work of the glands. This
assertion, which is so categorically set forth in
many text-books of physiology, and which consequently
has gained hold of the mind of the physician,
is nothing else than a sad misconception
degenerated into a stubborn prejudice. My
own statement, repeated in many published articles,
and at the meetings of various medical societies,
that this dictum is only a picture of the
imagination, has met, for the most part, either
with an unbelieving shake of the head or else
with a direct avowal that “it cannot be so.” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
regret exceedingly that these steadfast unbelievers
are not here, so that we might together
bring the matter before the tribunal of fact, to
the demonstration of which we will now proceed.
To this matter I attribute very great importance.
It is on this ground, according to my opinion,
that the whole battle must be fought out between
the generally accepted view that every
agency is capable of exciting the gastric mucous
membrane and the theory that it is only
excitable by specific and selected stimuli. If
once the defenders of the old opinion are driven
from their position and obliged to admit the
inefficiency of mechanical stimulation, there
would be nothing further left for them than to
build up new theories and search out old facts
concerning gland work which have hitherto been
rigidly kept in the shade. We may take it that
it is mainly because people were so seized with
the belief in the direct and simple mechanical
explanation that Bidder and Schmidt’s experiment
of the excitation of gastric secretion by
mental effect has been so little taken into consideration,
notwithstanding that it appeared so
thoroughly reliable and convincing.</p>

<p>I will now repeat the experiment of mechanical
stimulation of the gastric mucous membrane
before you in the well-known, traditional, and
classic manner. Here is a dog with a gastric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
fistula on which a cervical œsophagotomy has
in addition been performed. I open the fistula;
as you see, nothing flows out of the stomach;
it was washed out clean with water an hour ago.
We take the celebrated feather and also a tolerably
strong glass rod. Folds of blotting-paper
saturated with red and blue tincture of litmus
are placed at hand. I now ask my assistant to
continuously move the feather and glass rod,
alternately, in all possible directions in the
stomach, changing from one to the other every
five minutes. On removal from the stomach
each is carefully dried with red and blue blotting-paper.
You have all seen, gentlemen, that
this procedure has now been kept up for half an
hour. From the fistular orifice not even a single
drop has escaped, and, moreover, the drops
of moisture on all the pieces of red blotting-paper
I have been able to hand to you have
assumed a distinct blue tinge, caused by the
moisture of the alkaline mucous membrane.
The blue pieces, however, have merely been
made wet without altering their colour. Consequently,
with the most thorough mechanical
stimulation of the whole cavity of the stomach,
we have not been able to find a single spot
possessing a noticeable acid reaction. Where,
then, are the streams of pure gastric juice of
which we read in text-books! What objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
can be raised against the conclusiveness of this
experiment? In my opinion only one: that we
are dealing with a dog out of health, whose gastric
glands from some possible cause are unable
to react normally. This single objection can
be set aside before your eyes. After failing
with the mechanical stimulation, we proceed
forthwith to the sham feeding of the same animal.
The dog takes the food offered it with
keen appetite, and you see that, exactly five
minutes after beginning the feeding, the first
drops of juice appear from the stomach, followed
by others faster and faster. I catch a couple
of drops on the blue litmus paper, and you see
that they produce bright red specks on the blue
sheet. After thirty minutes’ sham feeding we
have collected 150 c.c. of juice, which, without
filtering, looks as clear and transparent as
water.</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, possibly doubt that,
when the proper stimulus is used, the gastric
glands react to it in a perfectly normal fashion,
furnishing a healthy gastric juice. From this it
irrefutably follows that only one explanation is
to be found for the negative result in the first
half of our experiment, viz., that the mucous
membrane of the stomach, so far as secretory
activity goes, is perfectly indifferent to mechanical
excitation. And yet this mechanical stimu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>lus
is demonstrated as an exciting agency in
the physiological lecture theatre. I venture to
think that this lecture experiment from now onwards
will quit the field, and give place to the
one I have just shown you. This apparently
simple experiment of mechanical stimulation
can, however, only be successfully performed
when certain very obvious rules are followed.
These, however, physiologists have not observed,
probably on account of a preconceived belief
in the effectiveness of the mechanical stimulus.
These rules are two. First, it is necessary that
the stomach should be clean, and that nothing
shall gain entry to it from without. Such conditions
were not formerly fulfilled. It is true
the stomach was emptied by removing the
stopper from the fistular cannula, but it was not
washed out till an acid reaction was no longer
given, and consequently preformed gastric juice
was left behind between the folds of the mucous
membrane. At the same time saliva from the
cavity of the mouth could gain entry, which
quickly became acidified in the incompletely
emptied and imperfectly washed-out organ. It
is, therefore, not surprising that the glass tube,
by setting up contractions of the stomach, was
the means of expressing small quantities of
acid fluid from the fistula-tube. (The relationship
between mechanical stimulation and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
motor functions of the stomach is not to be confounded
with what we are here speaking of.)
That matters are as I state, and that the facts
correspond to the explanation is proved by
this; namely, that nobody till now has obtained
genuinely pure gastric juice of an acidity
amounting to 0.5 or 0.6 per cent. It is only
necessary to call to mind that Heidenhain, when
determining the acidity of the juice first obtained
from the resected stomach, was placed in
no little doubt as to whether his results (0.5 to
0.6) were correct, and his assistant at the time
(Gscheidlen) was set to verify the correctness
of his standard solutions. The acidity of the
“purest” juice known at that time was scarcely
0.3 per cent. As a further proof that none of
the older observers ever really obtained a secretion
from mechanical stimulation pure and simple,
we may adduce the fact that none of them
made mention of the constant and precise period
of five minutes’ latency. To overlook this was
not possible if a genuine excitation of the
glands had been obtained.</p>

<p>Of no less importance is the second condition
when we wish to perform the experiment
of mechanical stimulation in the correct way.
It is very necessary that the gastric glands be
not already in activity at the beginning of the
experiment, and also that during the experi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>ment
no impulse comes into play, which of
itself, apart from mechanical excitation, could
excite the glands to secretion. Nor have we
any proof that observers formerly waited for
hours before commencing the experiment and
convinced themselves that the gastric glands
had ceased working. On the contrary, we have
not the slightest evidence to indicate that the
authors had attempted to guard against accidental
psychical stimulation of the glands&mdash;a
matter which we have seen is of considerable
difficulty. And some dogs are so easily excited
in this way that it is almost impossible to bring
their glands to rest, or at least it is necessary to
wait for hours. The experimenter must strain
his whole attention to preserve such an experiment
free from objection. It is only necessary
that some food be near the dog, or that the
hands of the attendant who has prepared the
food should smell of it, or that some other
similar circumstance should come into play,
and the glass tube, quite undeservedly, will be
made answerable for the excitation of the gastric
glands. As you have just seen, both of our
conditions have been fulfilled on the dog before
you, and the result of the experiment stands
in irreconcilable contradiction to those of the
laboratory and lecture experiment of former
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>The importance of the experiment, which I
have already dwelt upon, justifies me in making
still further demands upon your attention in
order to show you two modifications of it.
Nobody has as yet said, with regard to mechanical
stimulation, that in order to obtain results
the mechanical agency must simultaneously come
into contact with numerous points of the inner
surface of the stomach. But in order to meet
this possible objection I will now show you two
new modifications. Again a similar dog is
used, that is to say, one on which both gastrotomy
and œsophagotomy have been performed.
The stomach has been washed out clean and is
at present in a state of complete rest. Into the
fistula I bring a thick glass tube containing a
number of small openings (2 to 3 mm. diameter)
at its rounded end. The other end of the tube
is connected with a glass ball containing tolerably
coarse sand. Leading into the ball is a
second tube, with which an india-rubber pump
can be connected and a blast of sand blown
through. By rhythmic compression of the india-rubber
ball I inject sand with considerable force
into the stomach, and this play is kept up for
ten to fifteen minutes; nevertheless, we see no
trace of gastric juice. The sand falls out again
between the side of the cannula and the glass
tube, and it is either dry or scarcely moistened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
but in no case is it able to turn blue litmus red.
And yet we are here dealing with a strong and
widely diffused stimulus. Look for a moment
at the performance of the bellows outside the
stomach. From every opening of the tube&mdash;numbering
considerably more than ten&mdash;a
strong stream of sand is ejected. If you hold
your hand against it, you feel quite distinctly
that the grains of sand strike with considerable
force. And now, when our experiment is ended,
we may convince ourselves by sham feeding, in
easy and unquestionable fashion, that the innervation
of the dog’s stomach is perfectly normal.</p>

<p>Yet another experiment on a similar dog.
Into its empty and resting stomach an india-rubber
ball is introduced. This is distended with
air by means of a syringe till it is as large as a
child’s head and maintained in this condition for
a time, afterwards being allowed to collapse.
The procedure is kept up for ten to fifteen
minutes. During this time not a single drop of
juice has appeared from the stomach. The surface
of the ball taken out of the organ is everywhere
alkaline. And here also subsequent sham
feeding shows that the dog is in a suitable condition
for the experiment. I must add that in
making this observation the dog must not be
too hungry, that is to say, must have been fed
within ten to twelve hours before, otherwise a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
psychic excitation of the secretion can readily
be induced.</p>

<p>If one dispassionately regards this question,
and if any of our methods for the study of gastric
secretion are reliable, one must be convinced
step by step in the laboratory of the
uselessness of mechanical stimulation. In the
case of dogs with an ordinary gastric fistula,
and failing some special reason, not a drop of
gastric juice ever escapes from the stomach
other than during the digestive period. How
could this be the case if the mechanical stimulus
were effective, since the inner rim of the
fistula-tube is continuously in contact with the
gastric mucous membrane? The same holds
good for the dog with resected stomach. During
the experiment a glass or india-rubber tube
is brought sufficiently far into the <i>cul-de-sac</i> to
catch the juice, and yet not a drop flows through
the tube, nor does its inner surface ever become
acid, so long as true secretory conditions are
absent. Moreover, the tube has tolerably often
to be taken out and set right.</p>

<p>In the ordinary gastric fistula in dogs, when
the operation has lasted a long time&mdash;over a
year&mdash;folds of mucous membrane are often
formed in the neighbourhood of its inner orifice
which completely close the tube. In these cases
a long, thick, perforated metal tube has to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
passed in deeply, and yet the manipulation of
itself never calls forth a secretion. Further, it
is a daily occurrence to find in the stomach of
the dog thick rolls of hair, and yet their presence
in no way hinders the arrest of the secretion,
which occurs when digestion has ceased.
Such an occurrence would have been specially
obvious in our dog with the isolated stomach,
since it was bedded with sawdust in order to
guard against maceration of the wound by juice
trickling out. Very often we found enormous
quantities of sawdust in the stomach, as much
as half a pound weight; obviously the dog had
licked the wound from adherent sawdust, which
it then swallowed, together with that sticking
to its nose. And yet these particles of sawdust
of themselves, which certainly acted as mechanical
stimuli, never caused a secretion. It appears
to me that this long series of facts ought to
suffice to carry the supposition to its grave
that by direct mechanical stimulation one is
able to set the neuro-secretory apparatus of the
stomach into activity.</p>

<p>And yet the feather and the glass tube
continue the even tenor of their ways to this
moment and function in some text-books, yea,
even in articles which specially treat of gastric
secretion as exciters of the gastric glands.
There are, it is true, a few physiologists who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
hold mechanical stimulation, in relation to gastric
secretion, not to be very effective, and give
it a subordinate position in the series of exciting
agencies, but as yet I know of no other physiologist
who has wholly denied its influence, and
who has not held it possible to obtain at least
some juice by it.</p>

<p>To conclude this lecture, we will take into
consideration a question connected with the
matter we have just discussed. Since the contact
of food with the gastric mucous membrane
has no direct influence on the secretion, is its
entry into the stomach devoid of all connection
with the secretory process?</p>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that, under normal
conditions, the stomach is the seat of certain
definite sensations, that is to say, its surface has
a certain degree of tactile sensibility. This sensation
is, as a rule, very weak, and the majority
of people become accustomed to pay no heed
to it in the normal course of digestion. They
obtain their sensations of general well-being,
and especially of satisfaction from the enjoyment
of food, without taking cognisance of the
factors contributing to them. The feeling of
general hunger, however, is referred solely to
the stomach.</p>

<p>On the other hand, all of us have met with
men who could describe exactly, and with gusto,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
how they were able to follow a special tit-bit,
or a mouthful of a favourite wine, the whole
way through the œsophagus down to the
stomach, especially when the latter happened
to be empty. Naturally the gourmand, who
directs his attention continuously to the act of
eating, can in the end distinctly perceive sensations,
and even call them up to the consciousness,
which in other people are normally
masked by other sensations and impressions.
We may therefore take it that the satisfaction
derived from eating is caused not only by
stimulation of the mouth and throat, but also
by impulses awakened by the passage of the
food along the deeper portions of the œsophagus
and by its entry into the stomach. In other
words, food which merely passes through the
mouth and throat produces less enjoyment and
excites, therefore, a less feeling of appetite than
the food which passes the whole way into the
stomach. The appetite, the eager craving after
food, is, indeed, a very complex sensation, and
often not merely the need of the organism for
food material is necessary for its excitement,
but also a condition of thorough well-being,
together with a normal healthy feeling in all
parts of the digestive tract. For this reason
it is easy to understand how patients who have
diseased sensations in these organs, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
have no feeling of appetite, no desire for food,
remember the sensations, whether consciously
or unconsciously, even when they are no longer
present. Cases are known to neuro-pathologists
where people with gastric anæsthesia
suffered from this loss of appetite. Such
patients are no longer conscious of having
stomachs, and dislike the idea of eating because
the food, as they express it, appears to fall into
a strange empty sack. In this way one can also
conceive how the appetite becomes lost in cases
of long-continued obstruction of the alimentary
tube. The patients forget their stomachs, and
in such instances direct introduction of food into
the organ, after an operation, may suddenly
bring back the appetite.</p>

<p>As a further illustration, I may be permitted
to give an instance from my own personal experience.
After an illness with which a transient
but high fever was associated, although
otherwise fully recovered, I had lost all desire
for food. There was something curious in this
complete indifference towards eating. Perfectly
well, I only differed from others in that I could
with ease abstain from all food. Fearing that
I should collapse, I resolved on the second or
third day to endeavour to create an appetite by
swallowing a mouthful of wine. I felt it quite
distinctly pass along the œsophagus into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
stomach, and literally at that moment perceived
the onset of a strong appetite. This observation
teaches that the tactile sensation of the stomach
at the moment of entry of food is capable of
awakening or increasing the appetite. It is
known that withholding food from the organism,
or in other words the creation of a necessity
for food, does not lead immediately, nor in
all cases, to the production of an appetite, to a
passionate craving for food. How often does
it happen that the ordinary hour for a meal has
struck, and yet, owing to some keenly interesting
occupation, not the least desire for food is felt?
It is known to everybody, indeed it has become
a proverb, that real appetite first sets in with
eating. If this be true, the initial impulse towards
awakening an appetite may originate in the
stomach and not in the buccal cavity. When
we spoke above of the desire for food being the
excitant of the secretory nerves of the stomach,
we naturally meant the passionate and conscious
longing for food, that which is called “appetite,”
and not the latent need of the organism for
nourishment, the lack of nutrition, which has
not yet been transformed into a concrete passionate
desire. A good example which enables
us to differentiate between these two factors is
furnished by our dogs with sham feeding. The
necessity for food exists in such cases even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
before the experiment; the juice, however, only
begins to flow as soon as this need has taken
the form of a passionate longing. It is therefore
quite possible that in the case of some
dogs, and at a certain stage of hunger, the
touching of the gastric mucous membrane with
any object at hand, its mechanical excitation,
its distension by the food mass, may give the
impulse which excites the appetite, and when
the appetite is awakened the juice flows. This
is possibly a third reason why, in the old experiment,
the mechanical stimulus came to be
considered effective. Viewed from this point
it may, to a certain degree, lead to a reconciliation
between my assertion concerning the inefficiency
of the mechanical stimulus and the
generally prevailing belief. I further also admit
that mechanical excitation will at times call into
play the work of the gastric glands, not however
directly by means of a simple physiological
reflex, but indirectly, after it has first awakened
and enlivened the idea of food in the dog’s consciousness,
and thereby called forth the passionate
desire. I hope that the foregoing will in no
way lead to a confusion of ideas in your minds,
but will assist you to an exact and concrete
analysis of the previous simple explanation of
the facts. This representation, which bears
more or less of a hypothetical character, could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
of course, be submitted to experimental proof.
For such it is only necessary to compare the
influence which sham feeding exercises in an
œsophagotomised dog with that in one having
a simple gastric fistula.</p>

and therapeutics of the digestive canal on the

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;To-day we shall endeavour to
bring the previously communicated results of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
our laboratory investigations into reconciliation
with the customs observed in the ingestion of
food, and with the regulations prescribed by the
physician in disorders of the digestive apparatus.
To bring our knowledge to full fruition, and so
secure for it the most useful application, the
same methods should be applied from the same
standpoint to the experimental investigation of
the pathology and therapeutics of the alimentary
canal. Nor should we be likely to encounter
insuperable difficulties. Thanks to the advances
of bacteriology, many of the pathological processes
can now be experimentally produced in
the laboratory. Moreover, we would, in a sense,
have to deal with external ailments, since our
present methods enable us to obtain access to
any desired part of the inner surface of the
digestive canal. In such pathological animals
the functional diseases of the apparatus could
be studied in a precise and detailed manner;
that is to say, the alterations of secretory
activity, the properties of the fluids, and the
conditions under which they appear could be
examined. On such animals therapeutic remedies
could also be tested, the whole process of
healing and the final result experimentally
observed, while the conditions of secretory
activity during every phase of the healing
process could be investigated. It can hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
be doubted that scientific, that is to say ideal,
medicine, can only take its proper position as
a science when, in addition to an Experimental
Physiology and Pathology, there has also been
built up an Experimental Therapeutics. A
proof that this is possible is furnished by the
recent vigorous strides made by the science of
bacteriology.</p>

<p>I have already described one of such pathological
therapeutic experiments; namely, on the
dog whose vagi nerves were divided in the neck.
Other similar cases I can also call to mind.
Our dog with the two stomachs suffered at one
time from a slight and transitory gastric catarrh.
It was then very interesting to observe that the
pathological process (which we were usually
able to wholly guard against) spread from the
large to the small stomach. It manifested itself
here in an almost continuous slimy secretion
of very slight acidity, but of strong digestive
power. At the beginning of the ailment, indeed
before it became fully established, the psychic
stimulation was remarkably effective (that is to
say, still furnished juice in appropriate quantity),
while local excitants almost completely failed.
One may conceive that the deeper layers of the
mucous membrane with the gastric glands were
still healthy, and thus easily thrown into activity
by central impulses, whilst the surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
membrane with the end apparatus of the centripetal
nerves was already distinctly damaged.
I mention these, which I may call impressions
rather than precise observations, because I
wish to point out what a fruitful field awaits the
investigator who wishes to study, with the aid
of our present methods, the pathological conditions
of the digestive organs and their treatment.
Such an investigation is all the more desirable
because clinical study of the same subject
(notwithstanding the zeal devoted to it during
the last ten years and the results derived therefrom)
has to contend with serious difficulties.
We must not forget that the sound or stomach-tube,
the chief clinical instrument, is more
uncomfortable than the ordinary form of gastric
fistula which was previously practised on animals,
and yet the physiology of the stomach,
even with the aid of the latter, made no material
progress for many long years. Nor is this
difficult to understand. The investigator obtained
through the fistula a mixture of substances
from which it was difficult, or even at
times impossible, to decide anything.</p>

<p>Hence the exact scientific study of therapeutic
questions in this region still belongs to the
future. But this does not exclude the probability
that the newer acquirements of physiology
may fruitfully influence the work of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
physician. But physiology naturally can make
no pretence to guide the field of medicine,
since the knowledge at its disposal is incomplete
and is much more restricted than that of the
broad world of clinical reality. As a recompense
for this, however, physiological knowledge
is often able to explain the causation of an
illness and the meaning of empirical curative
methods. To employ a remedy the mode of
action of which is not clear is quite a different
thing from knowing precisely what we are
doing. In the latter case the treatment of the
diseased organ will be more effective because
it will be better adapted to the special needs of
the case. It is thus that medicine, being daily
enriched by new physiological facts, will at
length grow into what it ideally must become;
namely, the art of repairing the damaged
machinery of the human body, based upon
<i>exact</i> knowledge, or, in other words, applied
physiology.</p>

<p>We may now return to our subject. If it
be at all admitted that human instinct is the
outcome of an every-day experience, which has
led to the unconscious adoption of the most
favourable conditions for life, it is particularly
so with regard to the phenomena of digestion.
The expression that physiology merely confirms
the precepts of instinct is justified here more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
than anywhere else. It appears to me also
that, in relation to the foregoing facts, instinct
has often made out a brilliant case when brought
before the tribunal of physiology. Perhaps the
old and empirical requirement, that food should
be eaten with interest and enjoyment, is the
most imperatively emphasised and strengthened
of all. In every land the act of eating is connected
with certain customs designed to distract
from the business of daily life. A suitable
time of day is chosen, a company of relatives,
acquaintances, or comrades assemble. Certain
preparations are carried out (in England a
change of raiment is usually effected, and often
a blessing is asked upon the meal by the oldest
of the family). In the case of the well-to-do a
special room for meals is set apart, musical and
other guests are invited to while away the time
at meals&mdash;in a word, everything is directed to
take away the thoughts from the cares of daily
life, and to concentrate them on the repast.
From this point of view it is also plain why
heated discussions and serious readings are held
to be unsuitable during meal-times. Probably
this also explains the use of alcoholic beverages
at meals, for alcohol, even in the lighter phases
of its action, induces a mild narcosis, which contributes
towards distraction from the pressing
burden of the daily work. Naturally this highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
developed hygiene of eating is only found in the
intelligent and well-to-do classes, first, because
here the mental activity is more strained and
the various questions of life more burning; and
secondly, because here also the food is served in
greater quantity than is required for the wants
of the organism. In the case of the poorer
classes, where mental activity is less highly
developed, the greater amount of muscular
activity and the constant lack of more than
sufficient nourishment insure a strong and lively
desire for food in a normal manner, without recourse
to any special regulations or customs.
The same conditions explain why the preparation
of food is so choice in the case of the upper
classes and so simple in that of the lower.
Further, all the accessories of the meal, which
are foretastes of the actual repast, are obviously
designed to awaken the curiosity and interest,
and to augment the desire for food. How often
do we see that a person who begins his customary
meal with indifference afterwards enjoys it
with obvious pleasure when his taste has been
awakened by something piquant or, as we say,
appetising. It was here only necessary to give
an impulse to the organs of taste, that is, to
excite them, in order that their activity might
be later maintained by less powerful excitants,
for a person who feels hungry such extra in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>ducements
are, of course, not necessary. The
quelling of hunger in his case affords of itself
sufficient enjoyment. It is not, therefore, without
reason that it is often said that “Hunger is
the best sauce.” This dictum, however, is only
right up to a certain point, for some degree of
appetising taste is desired by everybody, even
by animals. Thus, a dog which has not fasted
for more than some hours will not eat everything
with equal pleasure which dogs usually
eat, but will seek out the food which it relishes
best. Hence the presence of a certain kind of
spice is a general requirement, although naturally
individual tastes differ.</p>

<p>This short discussion as to how different
people behave with regard to the act of eating
is of itself testimony that care should ever be
taken to keep alive the attention and interest
for food and to promote enjoyment of the
repast&mdash;that is to say, that care should be
taken of the appetite. Every one knows that a
normal, useful food is a food eaten with appetite,
with perceptible enjoyment. Every other
form of eating, eating to order or from conviction,
soon becomes worse than useless, and the
instinct strives against it. One of the most
frequent requests addressed to the physician is
to restore the appetite. Medical men of all
times and of every land have held it to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
pressing duty, after overcoming the fundamental
illnesses of their patients, to pay special attention
to the restoration of the appetite. I believe
that in this they are not only animated by an
endeavour to free their patients from troublesome
symptoms, but also by the conviction that
the return of appetite of itself will favour the
restitution of normal digestive conditions. It
may be said that to the same extent to which
the patient wishes back his appetite the physician
has effectively employed measures to restore
it. Hence we have not a few remedies
which are specially named “gastric tonics,”
and whose action is to promote appetite. Unfortunately
medical science has latterly deviated
from this, the correct treatment of the appetite,
and that which corresponds to the real conditions.
If one reads current text-books on disorders
of digestion, it is remarkable how little
attention is paid to appetite as a symptom or to
its special therapy. Only in a few of them is
its importance indicated, and then merely in
short, parenthetic phrases. On the other hand,
one may meet statements in which the physician
is recommended to adopt no special means for
counteracting so unimportant a subjective symptom
as a bad appetite! After what I have said
and demonstrated to you in these lectures, one
can only designate such views as gross miscon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>ceptions.
If anywhere, it is precisely here that
symptomatic treatment is essential. When the
physician finds it necessary, in disorders of
digestion, to promote secretory activity by
different remedies, this object can most certainly
and completely be achieved by endeavouring to
restore the appetite. We have already seen
that no other excitant of gastric secretion, so far
as quantity and quality of the juice are concerned,
can compare with the passionate craving
for food.</p>

<p>To a certain degree we can understand&mdash;and
this contributes to an explanation of matters&mdash;how
medical science of our time has
come to regard so lightly the loss of appetite
as a special object for treatment. Now, however,
the experimental method has penetrated
more and more into medical science, with the
result that many pathological factors and therapeutic
agents are judged of according to whether
they hold good in the laboratory or not&mdash;that
is to say, they are valued only in so far as they
can be verified by laboratory experiments.
Naturally we do not doubt that a movement in
this direction indicates a great advance, but
even here, as with every undertaking of mankind,
things do not proceed without mistakes
and exaggerations. We must not consider an
event to be a mere picture of the imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
because it is not realisable under given experimental
conditions. We often do not know all
the essential conditions for the production of
the phenomenon in question, nor are we yet
able to grasp the connection between all the
separate functions of life as fully as may be
desired. Thus in the clinical treatment and
pathology of digestion assistance was sought
for in the laboratory, but nothing was there met
with which had a relation to appetite, and consequently
this factor was overlooked in medical
practice. As stated above, the psychic gastric
juice obtained only cursory mention in physiology,
and this not even by all authors; and
when it was noticed it was related more as a
curiosity. Great importance was, on the other
hand, assigned to the mechanical stimulus, the
efficiency of which, now that our knowledge is
more complete, has been shown to be purely
imaginary. Each of the contending factors has
at length been assigned its proper place, and
if clinical medicine maintains her worthy desire
of following out the experimental investigation
of her problems, she must in actual practice
accord to appetite its old claim for consideration
and treatment.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the indifference of
physicians to appetite in itself, many therapeutic
measures are based on the promotion of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
And in this the truth of empiricism makes itself
irresistibly felt. When the patient is enjoined
to eat sparingly, or when he is restrained from
eating at all till the physician expressly permits,
or again, when he is (for instance, during convalescence)
removed from his ordinary surroundings
and sent to an establishment where
the whole life, and particularly the eating, is
regulated according to physiological needs&mdash;in
all these cases the physician seeks to awaken
appetite, and relies upon it as a factor in the
cure. In the first case, where the food is prescribed
in small portions, in addition to preventing
the overfilling of a weak stomach, the
oft-recurrence of appetite juice, which is so rich
in quantity and so strong in digestive power,
is of great importance. I ask you here to call
to mind one of our experiments in which food
was given in small portions to a dog, and thus
led to a secretion of much stronger juice than
if the whole ration had been eaten at once.
This was an exact experimental reproduction
of the customary treatment of a weak stomach.
And such a regulation of diet is all the more
necessary, since, in the commonest disorders
of the stomach, only the surface layers of the
mucous membrane are affected. It may, consequently,
happen that the sensory surface of
the stomach, which should take up the stimulus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
of the chemical excitant, is not able to fulfil its
duty, and the period of chemical secretion,
which ordinarily lasts for a long time, is for the
most part disturbed, or even wholly absent. A
strong psychic excitation, a keen feeling of
appetite, may evoke the secretory impulse
in the central nervous system and send it
unhindered to the glands which lie in the
deeper as yet unaffected layers of the mucous
membrane.</p>

<p>An instance of this, taken from the pathological
material of the laboratory, I have already
related at the beginning of this lecture. It is
obvious in these cases that the indication is to
promote digestion by exciting a flow of appetite
juice, and not to rely upon that excited by
chemical stimuli. From this point of view the
meaning of removing a patient, the subject of
chronic weakness of the stomach, from his
customary surroundings is also plain. Take,
for instance, a mentally overstrained individual,
or a responsible official; how often does it
happen that he cannot for a moment distract
his thoughts from his daily work. He eats
without noticing it, or eats and carries on his
work at the same time. This often happens,
particularly in the case of people who live in
the midst of the incessant turmoil of great cities.
The systematic inattention to the act of eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
prepares the way for digestive disturbances in
the near future, with all their consequences.
There is no appetite juice, no “igniting juice,”
or, at most, very little. The secretory activity
comes slowly into play; the food remains much
longer in the digestive canal than is necessary,
or passes, for want of sufficient digestive juices,
into a state of decomposition which irritates the
mucous membrane of the alimentary canal and
brings it into a condition of disease. No
medicinal treatment can help such a patient
while he remains surrounded by his old conditions.
The fundamental cause of his illness
still continues in progress. There is only one
course to pursue; namely, to take him completely
away, to free him from his occupation,
to interrupt the interminable train of thought,
and to substitute for a time, as his only object
in life, the care of his health, and a regard for
what he eats. This is attained by sending the
patient to travel, or by placing him in a hydropathic
establishment. It is the duty of the
physician to regulate not only the life of individual
patients according to such rules, but
also to have a care that in wider circles of the
community a due conception of the importance
of eating should be disseminated. This is
particularly so with the Russian physician. It
is precisely in the so-called intelligent classes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
of Russians that a proper conception of life
generally is often found wanting, and where an
absolutely unphysiological indifference towards
eating often exists. More methodical nations,
like the English, have made a species of cult
of the art of eating. It is, of course, degrading
to indulge excessively and exclusively in culinary
enjoyments, but, on the other hand, a lofty contempt
for eating is also reprehensible. As so
often is the case, the best course here also lies
between the two extremes.</p>

<p>With the establishment of mental effect upon
the secretion of juice the influence of condiments
enters upon a new phase. The conclusion had
already been empirically arrived at that it was
not alone sufficient for the food to be composed
exclusively of nutrient substances, but that it
should also be tasty. Now, however, we know
why this is so. For this reason the physician,
who has often to express an opinion upon the
suitability of the dietaries of different persons,
or even of whole communities, should constantly
bear in mind the question of psychic secretion;
that is to say, he should inquire after and learn
how the food has been eaten, whether with or
without enjoyment. But how often do the
people who have charge of the commissariat
pay attention solely to the nutritive value of the
food, or place a higher value on everything else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
than taste? We must, further, in the interest
of the public weal, direct attention especially
to the feeding of children. If this or that inclination
of the taste ultimately determines the
relation of grown-up individuals towards food,
a matter with which the commencing phase of
digestion is closely linked, it would seem undesirable
to habituate children solely to a nicety
and uniformity of gustatory sensations. Such
might effect their capabilities of adapting themselves
to other conditions in after life.</p>

<p>The question of the therapeutic influence of
the so-called bitters, it appears to me, bears the
closest connection with that of appetite. After
a long period of high repute these substances
have been almost expelled from the list of
pharmaceutic remedies. When tested in the
laboratory, they were unable to justify their old
and valued reputation; when directly introduced
into the stomach, many of them were unable to
produce a flow of gastric juice. Consequently,
in the eyes of the clinician, they became greatly
discredited, so that many were quite ready to
discard their use altogether. Obviously, the
simple conclusion was drawn that a weak digestion
could only be assisted by a remedy which
directly excites secretory activity. In this, however,
it was forgotten that the conditions of the
experiment possibly had not corresponded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
the actual state of affairs. The whole question
of the therapeutic importance of the bitters,
however, acquires a different significance when
we link it with another question, such, for
instance, as how do bitters affect the appetite?
It is the universal opinion of the earlier and
later physicians that bitters increase the appetite,
and if this be so everything is said. They
are, in consequence, real secretory stimulants,
since the appetite, as has many times been
repeated in these lectures, is the strongest of
all stimuli to the digestive glands. It is, however,
not by any means strange that this had
not previously been observed in the laboratory.
The substances were either introduced directly
into the stomachs of normal dogs or else injected
into the circulation. But their action is
chiefly bound up with their effect upon the gustatory
nerves, and it was not, therefore, without
some reason that this large group of remedies,
consisting of substances of the most varied chemical
composition, were grouped together mainly
on account of a certain bitter taste common to
them all. A person who suffers from digestive
disturbance has, moreover, a blunted taste, a
certain degree of gustatory indifference. The
ordinary foods, which are agreeable to other
people, and also to himself when in health, now
appear tasteless. They not only arouse no desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
for eating, but may even cause a feeling of dislike;
there is no sense of taste, or at best a
perverse one. It is necessary, therefore, that
the gustatory apparatus should receive a strong
stimulus in order to restore a normal sensation.
As experience teaches, this object is
most quickly attained by exciting sharp, unpleasant,
gustatory impressions, which by contrast
awaken the idea of pleasant ones. In either
case there is no longer indifference, and this
is the foundation upon which an appetite for
this or that kind of food may be awakened, and
here a general physiological law is illustrated.
The light appears brighter after darkness, a
sound louder after silence, the enjoyment of
blithesome health more intense after illness,
and so on. This explanation of the appetising
effects of bitters proceeding from the mouth
does not exclude the possibility of some such
similar influence coming also from the stomach.
As has been already stated in the fifth lecture,
there is some reason for believing that certain
impulses from the cavity of the stomach are
likewise necessary for the excitation of appetite.
It is possible that bitters not only act directly
on the gustatory nerves in the mouth, but that
they also act on the mucous membrane of the
stomach in such a way that sensations are generated
which contribute to the passionate crav<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>ing
for food. As a matter of fact, it has been
confirmed by many clinicians that after the
administration of bitters some such special sensations
do arise in the stomach. The effect of
these remedies consists, therefore, not merely
in the generation of a simple reflex, but in the
production of a certain psychic effect, which
indirectly excites a physiological secretory activity.
The same probably applies to other
substances, such as condiments. In any case,
whether our explanation corresponds to the
actuality or not, the question of the therapeutic
effect of bitters is settled in the affirmative the
moment we acknowledge that these substances
awaken appetite. The problem, therefore, of
an experimental investigation of bitters consists
in establishing the fact that they have an effect
upon the appetite. The question is a difficult
one, and has not hitherto been attempted in
the laboratory. It is not sufficient to hand over
clinical observations to the laboratory as experimental
proofs. One must have, in addition, the
assurance that the investigation has been correctly
carried out; that is to say, that it dealt
exactly with the point under consideration. It
is interesting to observe that the connection
between appetite and gastric juice is by many
physicians, and in many text-books of medicine,
exactly reversed. Thus it is represented that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
some medicinal remedy calls forth a secretion
of gastric juice, and this, by its presence in the
stomach, awakens an appetite. Here we have
to deal with a false explanation of a true fact,
and that because it was not recognised that a
psychic effect could by any possibility be a
powerful excitant of secretory nerves. The
customs of the chief meal of the day also correspond
with our physiological results. After
this or that <i>hors d’œuvre</i>, perhaps also with a
liqueur of brandy (especially customary in
Russia), both of which are designed to awaken
the appetite, the repast proper begins, and, in
the majority of cases, with something hot, consisting
mostly of meat broth (<i>bouillon</i>, different
soups, and so on). After this comes the really
nourishing food&mdash;meat of different kinds served
in various ways, or, in the case of poorer people,
stews made with vegetables, and therefore rich
in carbohydrate material. This sequence of
foods, from the standpoint of physiology, is
quite rational. Meat broth, as we have already
seen, is an important chemical excitant of gastric
secretion. An attempt is therefore made in two
ways to secure a free secretion of gastric juice
to act on the chief food; first, in the excitement
of the appetite juice by the <i>hors d’œuvre</i>, and
secondly, in the promotion of the flow by the
action of the meat broth. It is in this way that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
human instinct has made provisions for the
digestion of the chief meal. A good meat
broth can only be afforded by well-to-do people,
and consequently with the poorer classes a less
expensive, and, indeed, also a less effective,
chemical excitant is used for awakening the
early secretion. For example, <i>kwas</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> serves
in this way with the Russian population, while
in Germany, where the price of meat is high,
different kinds of soups are used, consisting of
water mixed with flour, bread, etc. It is further
to be borne in mind that the quantity of the
digestive juices in general stands in close connection
with the content of water in the organism.
This has been shown by the experiments
of Dr. Walther for the pancreatic juice, and by
my own for the gastric juice. If this sequence
of foods, therefore, holds good for healthy
people, it must be even more strictly adhered
to in pathological conditions. Thus, when a
person has no appetite, or only a weak one,
he has no psychic juice or only very little; consequently,
the meal must in every case be begun
with a strong chemical excitant&mdash;for example,
with a solution of the extractives of flesh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Otherwise solid foods, particularly if they do
not consist of meat, would remain long in the
stomach without any digestion whatever. It is,
therefore, in every way desirable to prescribe
meat juice, strong broth, or meat extract to
people who have no appetite. The same applies
also to forced feeding, for instance, of the
insane. It is true that the method of introduction
in this case necessarily secures the presence
of a chemical excitant, since the food can only
be introduced in a fluid form. In any case the
addition of meat extract would be very useful.
If one arranged the ordinary fluid foods in descending
order, according to the influence of
the chemical excitants, the following would be
the series: first, the preparations of the flesh,
such as meat juice and the like; secondly, milk;
thirdly, water.</p>

<p>The usual termination of the repast is also,
from the physiological standpoint, easy to be
understood. The chief meal is generally ended
with something sweet, and everybody knows
that sweets are pleasant. The meaning of this
is easy to guess. The repast, begun with pleasure,
consequent on the pressing need for food,
must also, notwithstanding the stilling of hunger,
be terminated with an agreeable sensation. At
the same time the digestive canal must not be
burdened with work at this stage; it is only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
gustatory nerves which should be agreeably
excited. After thus dealing in general with the
usual arrangement of our meals, we may now
speak of some special points.</p>

<p>Above all comes the acid reaction of the
food. It is apparent that acidity enjoys a
special preference in the human taste. We
use quite a number of acid substances. Thus,
for example, one of the commonest seasoning
substances is vinegar, which figures in a number
of sauces and such like. Further, many
kinds of wine have a somewhat acid taste. In
Russia, <i>kwas</i>, especially in the acid form, is
consumed in great quantities. Moreover, acid
fruits and green vegetables are used as food, and
they are either of themselves acid, or made so
in the preparation. In medicine this instinct
is likewise often made use of, and acid solutions,
especially of hydrochloric and phosphoric
acids, are prescribed in digestive disturbances.
Finally, Nature itself constantly endeavours to
prepare lactic acid in the stomach in addition
to the hydrochloric acid. The former arises
from the food introduced, and is consequently
always present. These facts are all physiologically
comprehensible when we know that an
acid reaction is not only necessary for an efficient
action of the peptic ferment, but is at the
same time the strongest excitant of the pan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>creatic
gland. It is even conceivable that in
certain cases the whole digestion may depend
upon the stimulating properties of acids, since
the pancreatic juice exerts a ferment action
upon all the constituents of the food. In this
way acids may either assist digestion in the
stomach where too little gastric juice is present,
or bring about vicarious digestion by the
pancreas where it is wholly absent. It is
easy, therefore, to understand why the Russian
peasant enjoys his <i>kwas</i> with bread. The
enormous quantity of starch which he consumes,
either as bread or porridge, demands
a greater activity upon the part of the pancreatic
gland, and this is directly brought about
by the acid. Further, in certain affections of
the stomach, associated with loss of appetite,
we make use of acids, both from instinct as
well as medical direction, the explanation being
that they excite an increased activity of
the pancreatic gland, and thus supplement the
weak action of the stomach. It appears to
me that a knowledge of the special relations
of acids to the pancreas ought to be very useful
in medicine, since it brings the gland&mdash;a
digestive organ at once so powerful and so
difficult of access&mdash;under the control of the
physician. We could, for instance, intentionally
discard digestion in the stomach, and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
transfer it to the bowel, by prescribing substances
which do not excite the gastric glands.
On the other hand, by lessening the acidity of
the gastric juice we could reduce the activity
of the pancreas, and these are matters which
might be made use of in various special diseases,
or even in some general disturbances
of the digestive apparatus.</p>

<p>No less instructive is a comparison of the
results of our experiments upon fat, with the
demands of instinct and also with the precepts
of dietetics and therapeutics. Everybody knows
that fatty foods are heavy, that is, difficult of digestion,
and in the case of weak stomachs they
are usually avoided. We are now in a position
to understand this physiologically. The existence
of fat in large quantities in the chyme
restrains in its own interest the further secretion
of gastric juice, and thus impedes the digestion
of proteid substances; consequently, a
combination of fat and proteid-holding foods
is particularly difficult to digest, and can only
be borne by those who have good stomachs
and keen appetites. The combination of bread
and butter is less difficult, as might <i>a priori</i> be
inferred from its wide employment. Bread requires
for itself, especially when calculated per
unit, but little gastric juice and but little acid,
while the fat which excites the pancreatic gland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
insures a rich production of ferment both for
itself and also for the starch and proteid of
bread. Fat alone does not count by any means
as a heavy food, as may be seen from the fact
that large quantities of lard are consumed in
certain districts of Russia with impunity. This
also is comprehensible, since the inhibitory influence
of the fat in this case does not prevent
the digestion of any other food-stuff, and is
conducive to the assimilation of the fat itself.
There is no struggle in this case between the
several food constituents, and therefore no one
of them suffers. In harmony also with daily
experience the physician, in cases of weakness
of the stomach, totally excludes fatty food and
recommends meat of a fat-free kind; for example,
game, etc. In pathological cases, however,
where an excessive activity of the gastric glands
is manifested, fatty food, or fat as emulsion, is
prescribed. And here medicine has empirically
brought to its aid the restraining action
of fat, which we have so strikingly seen in our
experiments.</p>

<p>Amongst all the articles of human food, milk
takes a special position, and this is unanimously
recognised, both in daily experience and in the
practice of medicine. By everybody milk is considered
a light food, and is given in cases of weak
digestion as well as in a whole series of severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
illnesses; for example, in heart and kidney affections.
The extreme importance of this substance,
a food prepared by Nature itself, we can now
well understand. There are three properties of
milk which secure it an exceptional position.
As we already know, in comparison with nitrogenous
equivalents of other foods, the weakest
gastric juice and the smallest quantity of pancreatic
fluid are poured out on milk; consequently,
the secretory activity requisite for
its assimilation is much less than with any other
food-stuff. In addition, milk possesses a further
important property. Thus, when it is introduced
unobserved into the stomach of an animal
it causes a secretion both in the stomach and
also one from the pancreas; consequently, it
appears to be an independent chemical excitant
of the digestive canal; and in this action it is
remarkable that we perceive no essential difference
in the effect when the milk is brought
unnoticed into the stomach from that which
occurs when it is given to the animal to lap.
Although flesh is a better chemical excitant,
it is by no means a matter of indifference how
it gets into the stomach. It must, therefore, be
accepted that milk excites not only a really
effective, but at the same time a very economic,
secretion, and also that the appetite is unable
to stimulate this secretion into a more active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
or abundant flow. The secret of the relation
of milk to the secretion of the digestive juices
can, unfortunately, at present be submitted to
no further analysis or investigation. We are at
liberty, however, to suppose that the fat on the
one hand is of importance for the inhibition
of the gastric glands, and the alkalinity on the
other for the restraint of the pancreas. Thus
the gastric glands and the pancreas, notwithstanding
the presence of excitants, are maintained
by milk at a certain but not too high
degree of activity, a matter which is in every
way desirable in consideration of the easy
digestibility of its constituents. Finally, the
third characteristic which is observed to belong
to milk, and which is probably only an expression
of the first, consists in the following. When
one administers to an animal equivalent quantities
of nitrogen, in the one case as milk, in the
other as bread, and afterwards estimates the
hourly output of nitrogen in the urine, it results
that the increase during the first seven to ten
hours after the milk (compared with the excretion
beforehand) amounts only to from 12 per
cent to 15 per cent of the nitrogen taken in,
while after bread it amounts to 50 per cent.
If the hourly rate of absorption and the extent
to which milk and bread are respectively used
up be taken into consideration, it has to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
admitted that these augmentations of urinary
nitrogen which appear soon after feeding must
be expressions of the functional activity of the
digestive canal itself, and that this activity in
the case of bread is three or four times greater
than in the case of milk (<i>Experiments of Prof.
Rjasanzew</i>); consequently, in the case of milk
a much larger fraction of its nitrogen is free to
be used up by the organism at large (irrespective
of the organs of digestion) than in that of any
other kind of food. In other words, the price
which the organism pays for the nitrogen of
milk, in the form of work on the part of its
digestive apparatus, is much less than that for
other foods. How admirably, therefore, the
food prepared by Nature distinguishes itself
when compared with all others!</p>

<p>The facts just related bring forward a new
aspect from which the relative nutritive values
of different foods may be judged. The older
criteria must frankly make room for the new or
else be displaced by them. Experiments upon
the utilisation of food-stuffs, in which what remains
undigested is determined as well as what
is absorbed into the body fluids, cannot alone
be trusted to solve the question in a satisfactory
manner. Suppose, for instance, that in the
digestion of a given food the alimentary canal
has been given a certain work to perform; if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
be in health the work will be accomplished in
the best possible manner&mdash;that is to say, with
complete abstraction of everything nutrient.
You will thus learn how much nutrient material
was contained in the food, but the question of
its digestibility remains as obscure as before.
In your experiment you do not know how great
an effort it has cost the alimentary canal to
extract all the nourishment from the food. Nor
can artificial digestion experiments settle the
question of digestibility, for experiments in
which food is normally partaken of are quite
different from those in the test-tube, where we
have to deal with only one juice, and not with
the interaction of different juices and different
food constituents. That one must here, as a
matter of fact, make a distinction is clear from
the observation of Dr. Walther in our laboratory.
Fibrin, which is regarded by all as the most
easily digested proteid, proved, when compared
with a nitrogen equivalent of milk, to be a much
stronger excitant of the pancreas, although milk
contains, in addition to nitrogenous substances,
a good deal of other non-nitrogenous material.
The digestibility and nutritive value of foods
must obviously be decided by an estimation
of the real work which they entail upon the
digestive apparatus, both in regard to the quantity
and quality of the juices poured out on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
given amount of nutrient material. The energy
used up in gland metabolism must be deducted
from that of food taken in. The remainder will
then indicate the value of the food to the organism;
that is to say, will give the amount available
for use by all the other organs exclusive of the
digestive apparatus. From this point of view
those materials must be taken as less nourishing
and less digestible which are in large part used
up to make good the expenditure entailed by
their digestion on the part of the alimentary
canal; that is to say, those food-stuffs are less
useful whose nutritive value little more than covers
the cost of their digestion; consequently,
it is of great practical importance to compare
from this aspect the same foods differently
prepared&mdash;for example, boiled and roast meat,
hard and soft boiled eggs, boiled and unboiled
milk, etc.</p>

<p>A discussion of some further medical questions
may here be taken up. The first concerns
the therapeutic use of the neutral and alkaline
salts of sodium. In clinical, pharmacological,
and physiological text-books it is stated now, as
ever, that these salts promote a flow of gastric
juice. We may look in vain, however, for any
experimental foundation to support this doctrine.
The experiments brought forward cannot be regarded
as conclusive. When Blondlot sprinkled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
sodium bicarbonate upon flesh, or Braun and
Grützner introduced sodium chloride solutions
directly into the blood, they began with methods
either false in themselves or far removed from
normal conditions. In this case, however, the
gaps in the experiment were happily made good
by the clinician, for the experiment appeared to
be confirmatory of clinical experience. That
sodium salts (the chloride and bicarbonate) are
useful in disorders of the digestive apparatus
there can be no doubt. How do they act, however?
It appears to me that here, as in some
other cases, medical science has fallen into error.
When we know that an effect takes place it does
not by any means imply that we know the mechanism
by which it occurs; and although medicine
is broad enough and comprehensive enough
to make free use of empiricism in practice, yet
it often thinks in narrow grooves when it turns to
the explanation of facts. It frequently tries to
explain complicated healing processes in the
simplest way, on supposed physiological data.
And this is true in the present case, which
affords an example of prevalent medical reasoning;
the alkalies work favourably in digestive
disturbances&mdash;therefore they are succagogues.
Naturally the stomach, under the influence of
alkalies, sometimes begins to secrete a greater
quantity of juice. This means, however, that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
has recovered from a disordered state and has
returned to normal conditions. Consequently,
the effect is due to the fact of recovery, and
not to a direct influence of the alkalies. This
latter, however, must be specially proved. The
assistance afforded by the alkalies to the organism
might be capable of another explanation;
for example, that which is ordinarily given. In
this case, however, I venture to offer a reason
for the effects of sodium chloride, and of the
alkaline salts of sodium, which is exactly the
opposite of that generally accepted. We were
unable to convince ourselves of any succagogue
influence on the part of these salts. Indeed,
both on the stomach and pancreas they proved
in our hands to have an inhibitory effect. In
addition to the experiments which I previously
brought forward concerning the relation of alkalies
to gastric and pancreatic juice, I may
relate the following observation. A dog which
fortunately had survived the performance, one
after the other, of a gastric fistula, a pancreatic
fistula, and an œsophagotomy, received daily
during the course of several weeks an addition
of soda to its food. The animal enjoyed good
health and had an excellent appetite. When
the first sham feeding experiment was carried
out, the relatively small effect of this otherwise
very active juice-exciting procedure at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
struck us. At the same time we observed that
the pieces of flesh which fell from the upper end
of the œsophagus, contrary to the ordinary rule,
were hardly at all insalivated. In this dog, therefore,
a greatly lowered activity of several digestive
glands&mdash;viz., of the gastric, pancreatic, and
salivary glands&mdash;simultaneously existed. With
regard to the salivary glands the circumstance
was naturally submitted to closer investigation.
I believe that the inhibitory influence of the alkalies
on the digestive glands, which was here
proved experimentally, may furnish a basis for
the following representation of their mode of
action in producing healing effects. Catarrhal
affections of the stomach are characterised by an
incessant or very protracted secretion of slimy,
weakly acid gastric juice. Further, in many
cases the affection begins with a hypersecretion,
that is an abnormal excitability, of the secretory
apparatus which makes itself evident in a superfluous
and useless flow. The same must be
conceived to happen in disorders of the pancreatic
gland; at least such a condition sets in after
operations performed for physiological purposes.
It is, further, justifiable to suppose that, when
an affection is once set up by this or that cause,
it may later maintain itself independently; for
continuous activity has undoubtedly a harmful
influence on the glands. The due nourishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and the restoration of organs after activity, proceeds
best during rest. In the normal course
of events, after a period of active work follows a
pause, during which the latent work of restoration
is accomplished. When, therefore, a remedy
effectively restrains the excessive work of a diseased
organ, it may in this way contribute to the
removal of the pathological condition, and thus
to a restoration of the normal state. In this consists,
in my opinion, the healing effects of the
alkalies. One might draw a parallel between
the action of these substances in digestive disturbances
and that of digitalis in compensatory
disturbances of the heart. An uncompensated
heart beats rapidly, and thereby only aggravates
its condition. Its time of rest, that is of
recovery, of restitution of the organ, is shortened.
A vicious cycle is set up. The weak action of
the heart lowers blood pressure; the lowering of
this leads (from known physiological causes) to
an increase in the number of beats; the quickening
leads to weakening of the organ. Without
doubt the digitalis aids by breaking through
this vicious cycle, in that it greatly slows the
pulse, and thereby gives new power to the heart.
With our explanation of the action of the alkalies
harmonises the further circumstance that, with
the use of the salts in question, a strict diet is
generally prescribed, which means that a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
amount of rest is secured for the digestive glands.
It is interesting that in clinical investigations
with the stomach-tube, after a period when the
alkalies were looked upon as succagogues, a new
phase has also set in, mention being now more
frequently made of a restraining effect.</p>

<p>The cause of the erroneous belief that alkalies
promote a flow of juice obviously lies in this,
that people omitted to compare the effects of
the saline solutions with those of like quantities
of water (<i>Dr. Chigin</i>).</p>

<p>The second point which we may consider is
the following. The chief difficulty of the physician
who wishes to regulate the diet of patients
when they suffer from digestive disturbances
consists in the fact that idiosyncrasy plays a
very important <i>rôle</i>. In one and the same illness,
different patients react to the same diet
in wholly different ways. That which is agreeable
to one, and is well borne and useful, may
be rank poison to another. Consequently, the
golden rule in dietetics is to give no directions
with regard to food till one has made inquiries
concerning the inclinations and habits of the
patient. What does all this indicate? Till now
physiology had no experimental answer to the
question. But our facts, it appears to me, contribute
to a clearing up of the situation. Every
food determines a certain amount of digestive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
work, and when a given dietary is long continued,
definite and fixed types of glands are set up
which can only slowly and with difficulty be
altered. In consequence, digestive disturbances
are often instituted if a change be suddenly
made from one dietetic <i>régime</i> to another, especially
from a sparse to a rich diet; such, for instance,
as happens after the long Russian fasts.
These disturbances are expressions of the temporary
insufficiency of the digestive glands to
meet the new demands made upon them.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be of some use to relate the
following here. There are often cases of sudden
and unaccountable digestive disturbances.
From the standpoint of modern physiology they
might be explained by an activity of the secreto-inhibitory
nervous system, which from some
cause or other has been excessively and abnormally
stimulated. In any case this system is
now a factor of which the physician has to take
due account.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In the beginning of 1896 Dr. Professor Henry
Pickering Bowditch, one of our Board of Scientific Assessors
in the Nutrition Case suggested the use of the Röntgen ray
as a means of learning more than was then known about the
mechanism of swallowing. There was much difference of
opinion among research physiologists about this important
function, and the question was far from settled. Magendie
published a theory of deglutition, in Paris, in 1836, which was
practically accepted until 1876, when Dr. Professor Angelo
Mosso, of the University of Turin, Turin, Italy, established
the theory of sole peristaltic assistance in swallowing. Again
in 1880 Dr. Professor Kronecker, of Berne, Switzerland, in
connection with Dr. Falk, and later in connection with Dr.
Meltzer, of New York, produced evidence to prove a more
complicated process in deglutition than that of peristalsis
alone. But even Kronecker and Meltzer found, as they went
on, evidence to modify their earlier beliefs, and hence the subject
was not cleared up to a point of general agreement.</p>

<p>The suggestion made by Dr. Bowditch was taken up in
the Harvard Physiological Laboratory and formed the beginning
of a series of studies of the mechanical factors in digestion.
The reports of these studies, presented by Dr. W. B.
Cannon and collaborators, in the <i>American Journal of Physiology</i>,
in the volumes of 1898 and 1903, are so understandable,
even to the layman ignorant of physiological nomenclature,
that we are prompted to give them, almost entire, leaving out
only the technical description of the methods employed, which
are only interesting to research students who have access to

IN THE ŒSOPHAGUS<br />

<p>The movements of deglutition, in common
with many other physiological processes, were
explained by the older physiologists on anatomical
grounds. Thus, Magendie divided the
act into three parts, corresponding to the anatomical
regions of the mouth, pharynx, and
œsophagus. The muscles of each of these
divisions were considered the active agents in
propelling the food onward. The function of
moving the mass to the pharynx was variously
ascribed to the tongue itself, to the mylohyoid
muscles, and to gravity. For the second part,
the movement through the pharynx, there was
more unanimity of opinion, since the constrictors,
especially the middle and lower, were
evidently concerned.</p>

<p>Direct observations on the movement of
swallowed masses in the œsophagus were first
made by Mosso. The œsophagus of a dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
was laid bare, and a transverse incision made
through it, or a piece of it excised. A small
wooden ball was placed in the canal below the
excised part, and the animal was then stimulated
to swallow. One or two seconds after the
contraction of the pharyngeal muscles a peristaltic
wave began to traverse the œsophagus.
This wave did not stop at the point of excision,
but in due time reappeared below, and carried
the ball to the stomach. Thus the act was
shown to be controlled by the central nervous
system. Peristalsis was so plainly the motive
power that the action was never doubted. Yet
this belief was soon to be questioned.</p>

<p>In 1880 Falk and Kronecker studied the
movements in the mouth and pharynx, and advanced
the theory that deglutition was accomplished
by the rapid contraction of the muscles
of the mouth. During the act of swallowing the
air-tight buccal cavity shows a manometric pressure
of twenty centimetres of water. The same
pressure was demonstrated to be present also in
the œsophagus, but not in the stomach. This
pressure was considered sufficient to force food
through the œsophagus before the peristaltic
wave traversed it. Another argument for rapid
descent was found in the fact that cold water
can be felt in the epigastric region almost immediately
after being swallowed. Further, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
strong acids pass through the gullet, they corrode
but small parts of it, and not the entire
mucous membrane, as would be the case were
the acid carried to the stomach by peristalsis.</p>

<p>Over a year and a half ago it was suggested
by Prof. H. P. Bowditch that if some substance
opaque to the Röntgen rays were swallowed, it
could be seen in its passage to the stomach, and
the nature of its movement thus determined.
Anæsthesia could be dispensed with,&mdash;a desirable
condition, since observers had found that
it interfered greatly with the deglutition reflex.
It would be unnecessary to open either the
abdominal or the pleural cavity. The reflex
stimulus of food, moreover, would be better
than electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal
nerve. In short, the animal would swallow
normal food under practically normal conditions.
At Dr. Bowditch’s suggestion and with
his valuable assistance&mdash;which we gratefully
acknowledge&mdash;we made the following series of
experiments.</p>

<p>To render the swallowed mass opaque, subnitrate
of bismuth was used. The salt is tasteless,
practically inert, and can be fed in large quantities
without harm. In order that observations
could be made by more than one person, all
experiments were conducted in a dark room.
On the side of the animal opposite the Crookes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
tube was placed an open fluorescent screen, on
which the different tissues of the animal were
outlined with varying degrees of light and shade.
Among these shadows the swallowed mass appeared
as a darker object, and thus its motion
could be studied.</p>

<p>For the first experiments the goose was
selected. The head and neck were held stationary
by a tall pasteboard collar, which allowed
free movement of the head without constriction
of the neck. The fluorescent screen was placed
against this collar at a uniform distance of thirty
centimetres from the tube. When a bolus of
corn-meal mush mixed with bismuth was placed
in the pharynx, it descended slowly and regularly,
and occupied about twelve seconds in
passing over a distance of fifteen centimetres.
The screen was marked at intervals of two centimetres
with cross lines, by means of which the
relative rate in different parts of the œsophagus
could be studied. A vibrator marking tenths
of a second was interrupted whenever the bolus
crossed a line. An average of over one hundred
such observations showed that the rate
became slightly slower as the bolus proceeded.</p>

<p>In order to test liquids, molasses was mixed
with bismuth to such a consistency as to drop
easily from a glass rod. When this was fed with
a pipette, it passed slowly and regularly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
the œsophagus, clearly by peristalsis. The rate
was about the same as for solid food. In both
these experiments the addition of water would
sometimes cause irregularities in the descent.
Microscopic sections from four different parts
of the œsophagus of the goose showed no histological
difference.</p>

<p>In the experiments on the cat, the animal
was placed on its back and left side on a holder.
The extremities were secured by straps. The
head was held between two upright rods, connected
above by a thong; this allowed free
movement of the head, without resistance to the
passage of food. Shreds of meat dipped in bismuth
were ordinarily masticated and swallowed
without difficulty. For soft solids, bread and
milk were used, so fluid as to be easily drawn
up into a pipette. The insolubility of the bismuth
salt rendered the study of liquids more
difficult. Strong solutions of potassic iodide
and other salts, and suspension of bismuth, in
acacia and molasses were tried; but a simple
mixture of milk and bismuth, shaken in a test
tube and immediately drawn up into a pipette,
was found most practicable.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the movement of these different
foods varied in different parts of the œsophagus,
it will be convenient to divide the latter into
three sections. The first or cervical portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
extends from the pharynx to the thorax; the
second or thoracic, from here to the lower half
of the heart; and the third comprises the rest
of the canal. The relative length of these three
parts is about in the ratio of 9:8:6.</p>

<p>The beginning of deglutition was noted by
one observer by a finger on the larynx; the
same observer called out when the bolus arrived
at the thorax, heart, and stomach respectively,
while the other observer noted the time. The
movement of solids will first be considered.
The descent the entire way was by peristalsis,
but the rapidity varied. The duration of the
movement in the cervical portion was two and a
half seconds, and in the thoracic region a little
less than two seconds. At the lower end of the
heart there was sometimes a slight pause. In
the lower section, from the heart to the stomach,
the movement was decidedly different; the
rate was always very slow. The distance was
less than one-third of the entire canal, yet the
time consumed in this part ranged from six to
seven seconds, or three-fifths of the entire time
of descent. The character of the movement
here was also peculiar. Whereas in the upper
sections the passage was uniform and regular,
with a slight acceleration in the thoracic region,
here it was apparently irregular, for the bolus
descended about one centimetre with each in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>spiratory
movement of the diaphragm, and
remained stationary or descended very slightly
during expiration. Thus a series of hitches
seemed to carry the bolus to the cardia. A
probable explanation of this peculiar movement
is that the stomach and lower œsophagus were
pulled down with each descent of the diaphragm.
This would make the movement appear irregular,
although it was really a slow peristalsis.
It may be well to remark here that this movement
was invariably observed in the cat with
every kind of food.</p>

<p>Semi-solids, namely, a mush of bread and
milk, descended in the same way as solids; but
the rate was slightly faster in the upper œsophagus,
for the bolus took about a second less to
reach the cardiac level. From here the rate
was the same as with solids.</p>

<p>For liquids, one and a half to two seconds
sufficed for the descent to the midheart region.
Here there often occurred a long pause, from
a few seconds to a minute or more. Then the
œsophagus apparently contracted above the
liquid, which slowly passed on to the stomach,
as already described. Sometimes it seemed
as if a swallowing movement, evidenced by a
rise of the larynx, started the peristaltic wave.
Again, several swallows would succeed one another
before the liquid passed on. A few times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the bismuth and milk seemed strung out along
the œsophagus; some more liquid descending
would gather this up, and the whole mass,
assuming an ovoid form, would move into the
stomach.</p>

<p>Thus in the cat the total time for deglutition
varies from nine to twelve seconds. The
lowest section presents no change ascribable to
a difference in consistency, while in the upper
sections the rate does slightly increase with the
more liquid character of the food.</p>

<p>In experiments on the dog, bismuth enclosed
in capsules or wrapped in shreds of meat
was fed as the solid. The general phenomena
were as follows: With the rise of the larynx
there was a quick, propulsive movement of the
bolus, which descended rapidly for a few centimetres,
sometimes as far as the clavicle. From
this point the rapidity was diminished, yet no
pause was observed; the bolus simply moved
more slowly. This rate was then continued to
the stomach without a slackening of speed in the
diaphragmatic region, as was observed in the
cat. Semi-solids moved in the same way as
solids. The total time of descent from larynx
to stomach was from four to five seconds.</p>

<p>Liquids gave even a more decided squirt in
the beginning of the movement. To render the
œsophagus as lax and free as possible, the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
of the dog was released from the upright rods
and held by the hands after the food was placed
in the mouth. Sometimes the liquid descended
rather rapidly as far as the heart, at other times
no further than the clavicle; then without a
pause it passed on slowly and regularly, reaching
the stomach in about the same time as solids
and semi-solids.</p>

<p>Thus in the dog and cat but little variation
was seen in the swallowing of liquids and solids.
The liquids pass somewhat faster in the upper
œsophagus. But in some animals the difference
of rate with foods of varying consistency is much
more marked. In the horse, for instance, mere
observation shows a decided variation in the rate
of movement in the œsophagus. Liquids shoot
along the gullet, while solids move clearly by
peristalsis. To determine the rate of solids, one
hand was placed on the larynx of a horse to
note the beginning of swallowing, and the other
hand near the shoulders, where the bolus could
be easily felt in its passage. The time consumed
by the bolus in passing over a certain
distance was measured by a stop watch. The
rate obtained for solids, such as hay or grain,
was from thirty-five to forty centimetres a
second.</p>

<p>For semi-solids, a mixture of bran and water
was made, thin enough to run easily between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
the fingers. Each bolus was watched by a
separate observer with a separate watch. The
average rate obtained was the same as for
solids.</p>

<p>Liquids in the horse pass with a rapidity too
great to be affected by peristalsis. Another
force must be sought. Among the various
muscles supposed to be effectual in moving food
into the pharynx, the mylohyoids were shown
by Meltzer to be essential. The styloglossi
were cut by him without much interference with
deglutition, but section of the mylohyoid nerves
rendered the act impossible. The activity of
these muscles in the horse during swallowing is
easily perceived by the hand. Their energetic
contraction is a sufficient explanation of the
rapid passage of water through the œsophagus.
The motion here is more than five times as rapid
as that of solids and semi-solids.</p>

<p>Meltzer’s experiment to measure the rate of
liquids in man by passing a stomach tube containing
litmus paper was repeated by us with
some modifications. Congo red paper was used,
since it is more sensitive than litmus; it also
furnishes a means of differentiating between
mineral and organic acids, as the discolouration
produced on Congo red by mineral acids is
removed by ether. It was thus possible to distinguish
between the discolouration produced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
gastric regurgitation and that produced by the
swallowed liquid. For the swallowed liquid,
one-half per cent lactic acid was found most
satisfactory, as the colour produced by it on
Congo red test paper is almost instantly discharged
in ether. By this method the paper
was found discoloured within half a second after
the rise of the larynx, certainly too short a
period for a peristaltic wave to carry the liquid
to the neighbourhood of the cardia.</p>

<p>The X-ray method lends itself less successfully
to the study of deglutition in man than in
the other animals we have studied. The thickness
of the thorax, the distance of the œsophagus
from the surface, and the relation to dense
tissues render the observation of a swallowed
mass difficult, especially when the mass is in
rather rapid motion. The few observations
which we have to report were made on a
seven-year-old girl, placed in the sitting posture.
Gelatine capsules containing bismuth were used
for solids, and were traced to a point below the
heart. The motion was very regular, and apparently
due to peristalsis, for the bolus descended
without a hitch or irregularity of any kind.
Sometimes the capsule became fixed in the
upper œsophagus, at about the level of the
second rib. Repeated swallows of water would
fail to dislodge it. An interesting point was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
noted here. With each attempt at swallowing,
the capsule would rise slightly, as if the œsophagus
was pulled up with the rise of the larynx;
then the capsule would descend to its former
position.</p>

<p>Semi-solids&mdash;a mush of bread and milk&mdash;could
be seen about as far as solids; that is, to
just below the heart. The motion of the mushy
bolus was the same as with solids, except that
the rapidity was perhaps slightly greater.</p>

<p>It should be noted here that with the human
subject, as well as with the horse, our results
for semi-solids differ from those derived by
Meltzer’s method; for according to his statements
semi-solids, like liquids, are squirted down
the œsophagus, and are not propelled by peristalsis,
as has been the case in our observations.</p>

<p>Liquids&mdash;bismuth and water&mdash;were seen
only in the neck and upper thorax. Here there
was a decided squirt. With the rise of the larynx
the liquid was seen to pass rapidly through
the pharynx and well down into the thoracic
œsophagus before it was lost to observation.
The rate, however, by estimation was less than
that of liquids in the horse.</p>

<p>There remains to be considered Meltzer’s
latest investigation, in which he endeavoured
to ascertain whether liquids remain above the
cardia till the arrival of the peristalsis, or ooze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
down before. An experimental answer was secured
by Meltzer by the following method. The
abdominal and gastric walls of an anæsthetised
dog were incised, and a tube (vaginal speculum)
introduced. Through this the entrance of food
into the stomach could be observed directly. In
repeated experiments no liquid was seen to pass
through the cardia before the arrival of the
peristaltic wave. An incision through the diaphragm
near its anterior origin showed that the
swallowed liquid was not squirted as far as a
point an inch above the diaphragm. To observe
the œsophagus nearer its beginning, the upper
three ribs were resected on the left side. Thus
the swallowed liquid was seen to shoot along
the œsophagus before any peristalsis reached
this point. The resection of the fifth rib exposed
the œsophagus half-way between the
bifurcation of the trachea and the diaphragm.
Here a bulging was sometimes observed immediately
after the beginning of the act, and the
swallowed mass remained there until a peristaltic
wave carried it down. If the mass swallowed
was small, or was projected with moderate
force, it might not even reach as far as the
bifurcation. From these experiments Meltzer
concluded that in animals, as in man, liquid food
is not carried down the œsophagus by peristalsis,
but is thrown rapidly into a deep part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
the canal. The depth reached depends on the
quantity swallowed, the force used, and the
tonicity of the lower part of the œsophagus.</p>

<p>The difference between these methods of
Meltzer and those employed in our experiments
has already been mentioned; and merely his
results, which were obtained with liquids alone,
need be considered here. According to our
observations on the dog, there was no distinct
pause at any part of the canal. The movement
simply became slower, and continued at this
rate until the stomach was reached. Neither
was the rate through the diaphragmatic part of
the œsophagus slower than through the thoracic.
The quick propulsive movement noticed in the
dog was observed with solids and semi-solids as
well as with liquids, but the liquids descended
further down the canal before the movement
changed to the slower peristalsis. While this
difference was evident to the eye, the total time
consumed by liquids in passing from pharynx
to stomach was not enough shorter than the
time for solids and semi-solids to be determined
by our measurements.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Summary.</span></h4>

<p>The phenomena of œsophageal deglutition
as determined by our experiments may then be
described as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>There is a difference in swallowing according
to the animal and the food which is used.</p>

<p>In fowls the rate is slow and the movement
always peristaltic, without regard to consistency.
A squirt-movement with liquids is manifestly
impossible, as the parts forming the mouth are
too hard and rigid. With this diminution of propulsive
power in the mouth there is observed a
greater reliance on the force of gravity. The
head is raised each time after the mouth is
filled, and the fluid by its own weight trickles
into the œsophagus, through which it is carried
by peristalsis.</p>

<p>In the cat the movement is always peristaltic,
and slightly faster than in fowls. A bolus takes
from nine to twelve seconds in reaching the
stomach. Liquids move somewhat more rapidly
than semi-solids in the upper œsophagus. In
the lower or diaphragmatic part the rate is very
much slower than above, and is the same for
liquids as for solids.</p>

<p>In the dog the total time for the descent of
a bolus is from four to five seconds. The food
is always propelled rapidly in the upper œsophagus,
and moves more slowly below. This rapid
movement is frequently continued further with
liquid food. No distinct pause was observed
when the movement of the bolus changed from
the rapid to the slower rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>In man and the horse liquids are propelled
deep into the œsophagus at a rate of several
feet a second by the rapid contraction of the
mylohyoid muscles. Solids and semi-solids are
slowly carried through the entire œsophagus
by peristalsis alone.</p>

<p>Since the stomach gives no obvious external
sign of its workings, investigators of gastric movements
have hitherto been obliged to confine their
studies to pathological subjects or to animals
subjected to serious operative interference.
Observations made under these necessarily
abnormal conditions have yielded a literature
which is full of conflicting statements and uncertain
results. The only sure conclusion to be
drawn from this material is that when the
stomach receives food obscure peristaltic contractions
are set going, which in some way
churn the food to a liquid chyme and force it
into the intestines. How imperfectly this describes
the real workings of the stomach will
appear from the following account of the actions
of the organ studied by a new method. The mixing
of a small quantity of subnitrate of bismuth
with the food allows not only the contractions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
the gastric wall, but also the movements of the
gastric contents to be seen with the Röntgen
rays in the uninjured animal during normal
digestion. An unsuspected nicety of mechanical
action and a surprising sensitiveness to nervous
conditions have thereby been disclosed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Introductory Literature</span></h4>

<p>The early writings on the subject of gastric
movements are characterised by general inferences
from physical laws and from the anatomical
structure of the stomach. According to
Galen the stomach had four functions: to draw
the food from the mouth (<i>facultas attractrix</i>),
to retain the food (<i>facultas retentrix</i>) during
the process of chemical digestion (<i>facultas
alteratrix</i>), and, finally, to pass the changed
material onward (<i>facultas expultrix</i>). In later
writings the <i>facultas attractrix</i> failed to appear
as one of the functions of the stomach. Fallopius,
in the sixteenth century, changed the notion
of the <i>facultas retentrix</i> by suggesting that the
pylorus alone performed this office, and that the
muscles of the gastric wall could help only by
remaining quiet. Thus the <i>facultas alteratrix</i>
and the <i>facultas expultrix</i> are left as true gastric
functions. It is with the latter activity and its
effects that this paper is concerned.</p>

<p>The ideas of the early writers concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
pylorus and cardia are of interest. The cardia,
they were agreed, is closed during normal digestion
in order to keep the food from re-entering
the œsophagus. The pylorus they looked
upon as the ruler of the actions of the stomach.
Such names as pylorus (keeper of the gate),
janitor justus, and rector, which the first investigators
gave to the sphincter, indicate their
theories of its functions. The passage of chyme
into the duodenum, the keeping of undigested
food in the stomach, the act of vomiting, were
all dependent, they believed, on the “will” of
the pylorus.</p>

<p>No substantial advance was made beyond
these hypotheses until the beginning of the
eighteenth century, when Wepfer and Schwartz
applied the experimental method to the study
of the gastric movements and laid the foundation
of a more accurate knowledge. Wepfer vivisected
wolves, dogs, and cats, and observed constrictions
following stimulation of the stomach.
He remarked a general contraction of the pyloric
part in vomiting and noted peristaltic and antiperistaltic
movements passing over the organ.
About the middle of the stomach he frequently
saw a deep constriction. The investigations of
Schwartz are more valuable in that his search
was for the normal action of the muscular coats.
The movements, as he observed them, were gen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>erally
only slight. They began either at the
pylorus and passed to the left, half-way to the
cardia, or started at the fundus and went to
the pylorus. The contractions and relaxations,
following one another, formed larger or smaller
depressions and elevations, <i>i. e.</i>, more or less
definite waves.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the last century Haller,
after confirming the results obtained by Schwartz
and Wepfer, summarised his knowledge of the
motor functions of the stomach as follows. In
general, contraction alternates with relaxation,
so that the stomach is, now here, now there,
made narrower by longitudinal or transverse
depressions; then in these same places relaxation
and bulging occur. So long as both apertures
are closed the food is driven hither and
thither by the shifting movements. It first takes
a definite direction when the cardia or the pylorus
opens. If the cardia opens, there is an
antiperistalsis followed by regurgitation and
vomiting. If, on the contrary, the pylorus
relaxes, a contraction, starting at the œsophagus,
pushes the contents of the stomach into
the duodenum. The pylorus allows the passage
of fluids, but if it be stimulated by over
distention or by hard pieces of food, it closes
tightly.</p>

<p>Such was the knowledge of gastric move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>ments
in Haller’s time. A comparison of his
descriptions with those in any standard work on
physiology published ten or fifteen years ago
will show that, despite very many researches,
little advance had been made. Examinations
of animals and men with gastric fistulas, studies
of the stomach through the atrophied abdominal
wall, and vivisection have yielded numerous results;
but these have not been harmonious, and
have led to much controversy. Prominent in
this mass of material as a valuable contribution
are Beaumont’s careful observations through the
gastric fistula of Alexis St. Martin. Beaumont’s
work has recently been confirmed by Hofmeister
and Schütz, who, with Rossbach, Hirsch, Openchowski,
and others, have presented during the
last twelve years much new and interesting information.
Since, however, it will conduce to
clearness to set forth the results of these investigations
in connection with my own work, their
consideration will be deferred until later.</p>

<p>It will then appear that these later investigations,
like the earlier researches, disagree as
to the details of the stomach movements. Such
differences in results are the proper outcome of
the abnormal conditions under which the studies
have been conducted. Obviously, in order to see
the natural movements of the stomach, the
organ should be observed in its natural state,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
and not after it has been disturbed by removal
from the abdomen, or by the adhesions and
losses of substance incident to gastric fistulas.</p>

<p>As a means of watching the gastric motor
activities under normal circumstances, Dr. H. P.
Bowditch, in the autumn of 1896, suggested the
use of the Röntgen rays. The present paper is
the result of the work thus far completed. The
kind assistance and stimulating counsel of Dr.
Bowditch throughout the investigation are
gratefully acknowledged.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Anatomy of the Stomach and its
Relations to the Shadow</span></h4>

<p>It must be constantly borne in mind that the
shadows described in this research are cast by
the gastric contents, not by the stomach itself.
Therefore the movements of the organ are not
seen directly, but are indicated by their effect on
the contained food. Variations in the length
and breadth of the stomach can be inferred from
changes in the outline of the shadow, but variations
in the front-to-back diameter of the organ
must be judged from changes in the intensity of
the shadow.</p>

<p>The form of the active stomach soon after
food has been taken is shown in outline in
Figure 1. Since the several parts of the stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
are to be mentioned frequently, it will be well to
recall them here in their relations to the outline.
The larger, cardiac part of the organ lies to the
left of a line through <i>w x</i>. Into it the œsophagus
opens through the cardiac sphincter, or
cardia, at <i>c</i>. The pyloric part, which includes
all of the stomach situated at the right of a line
<i>w x</i>, is closed by the pylorus at <i>p</i>. This part
has two divisions: the antrum at the right of the
line <i>y z</i>, and the preantral part of the pyloric
portion, or middle region of the stomach, between
the lines <i>w x</i> and <i>y z</i>. The lesser curvature
corresponds approximately to the anterior
border of the shadow <i>c w p</i>; the greater curvature
to the more extensive sweep, <i>c p</i>, along the
posterior border.</p>

</div>

<p>The wall of the cat’s stomach consists of
three coats, but as this paper deals only with the
functions of the muscular coat, that alone will
be described. The gastric muscular fibres are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
disposed in three sets: an outer longitudinal
layer, a middle circular layer, and a set of inner
oblique fibres. The longitudinal fibres continue
those of the œsophagus, and, radiating over the
cardiac end, become more marked along the
curvatures than on the front and back surfaces.
Over the antrum they lie in a thick, uniform
layer. The circular fibres form a complete
investment, and are arranged in rings at
right angles to the curved axis of the stomach.
Towards the pyloric end they become denser and
stronger, and at the pylorus form a thick bundle,
the pyloric sphincter. Separating the antrum
from the rest of the stomach, at <i>y z</i>, is a special
thickening of the circular fibres, called by the
early writers the “transverse band,” and described
by Hofmeister and Schütz as the “sphincter antri
pylorici.” The oblique fibres start from the left
of the cardiac orifice and pass as two strong
bands along the anterior part of the dorsal and
ventral surfaces, giving off fine fasciculi to the
circular musculature; towards the antrum they
gradually disappear.</p>

<p>The musculature of the stomach consists of
smooth muscle fibres, the chief physiological
characteristics of which are slowness of contraction,
rhythmic alternation of contraction
and relaxation, and a very great tonicity, or
power of prolonged contraction. The action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
these muscles in the process of gastric digestion
is now to be considered.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Normal Movements of the
Stomach</span></h4>

<p>Since the time of Haller the chief contributors
to the knowledge of the mechanics of
the stomach have been Beaumont, Hofmeister
and Schütz, and Rossbach.</p>

<p>Beaumont’s famous investigations on Alexis
St. Martin are recorded in almost all general
works on physiology. Through a gastric fistula
he introduced a thermometer-tube and observed
how it was affected by the motions of the
stomach. His conclusions are as follows: “The
circular or transverse muscles contract progressively
from left to right. When the impulse
arrives at the <i>transverse band</i>, this is excited
to a more forcible contraction, and closing
upon the alimentary matter and fluids contained
in the pyloric end, prevents their regurgitation.
The muscles of the pyloric end, now contracting
upon the contents detained there, separate and
expel some portion of the chyme.... After
the contractile impulse is carried to the pyloric
extremity, the circular band and all the transverse
muscles become relaxed, and a contraction commences
in a reversed direction, from right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
left, and carries the contents again to the splenic
extremity to undergo similar revolutions.”</p>

<p>In close accord with Beaumont’s description
of the activities of the human stomach are the
records of the investigations on the stomach of
dogs by Hofmeister and Schütz. They removed
the stomach from the body and placed it
in a moist chamber, kept at body-heat and
covered with glass. Under such conditions
the organ remained active for from sixty to
ninety minutes. A typical movement is described
by these observers as composed of two phases.
In the first phase a constriction of the circular
fibres, deeper on the greater curvature, starts a few
centimetres from the cardia and passes towards
the pylorus. As the constriction proceeds it
increases in strength until a maximum is reached
about two centimetres in front of the antrum.
This annular contraction, called by Hofmeister
and Schütz the “preantral constriction,” closes
the first phase. Immediately thereafter the
strong sphincter antri pylorici, or transverse
band, contracts. Now, while the preantral constriction
is relaxing, the sphincter antri pylorici
tightens still more, and the antrum is shut off
from the rest of the stomach. As soon as this
has occurred a general contraction of the muscles
of the antrum follows. Relaxation begins at the
sphincter antri pylorici and progresses slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
towards the pylorus; it is sometimes accompanied
by an antiperistaltic movement.</p>

<p>Although Rossbach also used dogs, his results
vary considerably from those of Hofmeister
and Schütz. This discrepancy is possibly accounted
for by a difference in method, for
Rossbach left the stomach in the body. The
dogs were treated with morphia and curare, and
the abdomen was then widely opened, so that the
movements could be clearly seen. When the
stomach was full Rossbach saw deep constrictions
begin near the middle and pass in waves
to the pylorus. At first these movements were
weak; later, however, they became more vigorous.
The fundus remained in tonic contraction
about its contents and took no part in the
peristalsis.</p>

<p>Before attempting to explain the difference
in the records of these observers I shall give an
account of what may be seen in a cat by use of
bismuth subnitrate and the Röntgen rays.</p>

<p>1. <i>Movements of the pyloric part.</i>&mdash;Within
five minutes after a cat has finished a meal of
bread, there is visible near the duodenal end of
the antrum a slight annular contraction which
moves peristaltically to the pylorus; this is followed
by several waves recurring at regular intervals.
Two or three minutes after the first
movement is seen very slight constrictions ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>pear
near the middle of the stomach, and pressing
deeper into the greater curvature, course slowly
towards the pyloric end. As new regions enter
into constriction, the fibres just previously contracted
become relaxed, so that there is a true
moving wave, with a trough between two crests.
When a wave swings round the bend in the pyloric
part the indentation made by it deepens;
and as digestion goes on the antrum elongates and
the constrictions running over it grow stronger,
but until the stomach is nearly empty they do
not entirely divide the cavity. After the antrum
has lengthened, a wave takes about thirty-six
seconds to move from the middle of the stomach
to the pylorus. At all periods of digestion the
waves recur at intervals of almost exactly ten
seconds. So regular is this rhythm that many
times I have been able to determine within two
or three seconds when a minute had elapsed
simply by counting six similar phases of the
undulations as they passed a given point. It
results from this rhythm that when one wave is
just beginning several others are already running
in order before it. Between the rings of constriction
the stomach is bulged out, as shown
in the various outlines in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The number of waves during a single period of
digestion is larger than might possibly at first
be supposed. In a cat that finished eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
fifteen grams of bread at 10.52 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the waves
were running regularly at 11.00 o’clock. The
stomach was not free from food until 6.12 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
During that time the cat was fastened to the
holder at intervals of half an hour, and the waves
were always observed following one another in
slow and monotonous succession. At the rate
of three hundred and sixty an hour, approximately
two thousand six hundred waves passed
over the antrum during that single digestive
period.</p>

<p>From the above review it will be manifest
that my observations of the movements of the
pyloric part agree closely with those of Rossbach,
but differ considerably from the harmonious
results of the work of Beaumont, and Hofmeister
and Schütz. Beaumont’s methods, however,
may be justly criticised on the ground that the
thermometer-tube which he held in the stomach
was wholly unlike food and very liable to bring
about unwonted contractions in so sensitive an
organ as the stomach. Further, the movements
observed by Hofmeister and Schütz, as Ewald
has pointed out, may easily have resulted from
the abnormal stimulus due to lack of blood&mdash;a
potent cause of peristalsis. And it will be
shown later that the accounts given by these
investigators describe very well the actions of
the stomach when stimulated by an unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
irritant. In this connection it may be added
that since the publication of the preliminary
notice of my work, Roux and Balthazard, using
the Röntgen rays, have published the results of
observations on the stomachs of the dog and
man similar to those thus far described in this
paper.</p>

<p>The fact that my observations and those of
Roux and Balthazard were conducted under
normal conditions, and that the conditions of
Rossbach’s experiments were more nearly normal
than those of the other observers mentioned,
warrants the conclusion that the pyloric part
has a more important function than that of
merely expelling the contents of the stomach
into the intestines. After summarising the
description given by Hofmeister and Schütz,
Ewald, for <i>a priori</i> reasons, declares: “I cannot
accept this view. The plain fact that the pyloric
portion secretes a strongly digesting fluid containing
pepsin and hydrochloric acid proves it
to be an important part for the peptonising
function of the stomach.” The account of the
remarkable manner in which the pyloric portion
performs this function must be deferred until
the movements of other parts of the stomach
have been considered.</p>

<p>2. <i>Movements of the pyloric sphincter.</i>&mdash;Rossbach
mars his otherwise careful work by de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>claring
that the pylorus is tightly closed during
the whole digestive period of from four to eight
hours, and that then the sphincter relaxes and
the peristaltic waves empty the stomach. That
this is not the normal action of the sphincter
has been shown by several observers. Hirsch
watched dogs with duodenal fistulas and saw
food come from the stomach at intervals of one-fourth
of a minute to several minutes. Roux
and Balthazard maintain that in dogs food enters
the duodenum at the completion of each
wave of constriction. Observations on the cat,
however, do not support their view, but agree
rather with the statement of Hirsch.</p>

<p>In cats fed with bread mixed with subnitrate
of bismuth, ten or fifteen minutes elapse after the
first constriction in the antrum before any food
can be seen in the duodenum. When food does
appear it is spurted through the pylorus and
shoots along the intestine for two or three
centimetres. Not every constriction-wave forces
food from the antrum. On one occasion, about
an hour after the movements began, three consecutive
waves were seen, each of which squirted
food into the duodenum. The pylorus remained
closed against the next eight waves, opened for
the ninth, but closed once more against the
tenth and eleventh. For each of the four
succeeding waves the sphincter relaxed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
blocked the food brought by three constrictions
that followed; and in this irregular way the
food continued passing from the stomach. Near
the end of gastric digestion, when the constrictions
are very deep, it may be that the
pylorus opens for every wave.</p>

<p>When a hard bit of food reaches the pylorus,
the sphincter closes tightly and remains closed
longer than when the food is soft. This action
of the sphincter was shown by giving with the
regular food of the cat a dry, hard pellet of
equal parts of starch paste and bismuth subnitrate
about the size of a pea. The food itself
contained merely enough bismuth to throw a
dim shadow, near the centre of which the pellet
could be clearly seen as a dark object. The
continual passing of the contraction-waves
finally brought the little ball to the pylorus.
When it arrived there, five grams of bismuth
subnitrate were introduced into the stomach
through a tube in the œsophagus. This was
done in order that the food passing into the
intestines after the ball came to the pylorus
might be distinguished from that which had
gone on before. By kneading the stomach the
bismuth was distributed, as shown by the uniformly
black shadow. The pellet could still
be seen near the end of the antrum when the
constrictions passed over it. Now, although the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
waves continued to run regularly, the very black
food did not gather in the intestines in sufficient
amount to be recognised until forty-two minutes
after it had been introduced. And when, finally,
the food did show itself in the intestines, its
shadow contrasted strongly with that of the food
which had already passed on. The slowness of
the expulsion is not to be regarded as wholly
due to the hard mass. No doubt the kneading
of the stomach mixed the contents of different
parts of the organ and brought to the pylorus
food not yet sufficiently digested to be passed
by that selective sphincter. But this does not
explain the whole delay. Food similar to that
given here, except that it contained no hard
particles, has usually been seen as small masses
in the intestines within fifteen minutes after being
swallowed. A part of the delay was evidently,
therefore, caused by the hard pellet. Further
evidence on this point was secured when, on
one occasion, the sphincter was seen to open
only seven times in twenty minutes following the
arrival of a hard particle of food at the pylorus.
The conclusion may therefore be drawn that
hard morsels keep the pylorus closed and hinder
the passage of the food into the duodenum.</p>

<p>3. <i>Activity of the cardiac portion.</i>&mdash;The
part played by the fundus apparently has not
hitherto been properly appreciated. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
regarded as the place for peptic digestion, or
as a passive reservoir for food; but it is in fact
a most interestingly active reservoir.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figure 5.</span>&mdash;Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 present outlines of the shadow
of the contents of the stomach cast on a fluorescent screen by the
Röntgen rays. The drawings were made by tracing the outline of
the shadow on tissue paper laid upon the fluorescent surface, and
are about one-half the actual size. They show the change in the
appearance of the stomach at intervals for half an hour, from the
time of eating until the stomach is nearly empty.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The action of the cardiac portion will be best
understood by comparing the appearances the
stomach presents at various stages in a digestive
period. In order to show these stages I care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>fully
made a set of three tracings of the outlines
of the stomach as soon as possible after a
cat had finished eating, and another set of three
every half hour thereafter, until the contents had
disappeared (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5). These tracings
were made by placing white tissue paper over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
the fluorescent screen, and drawing with a thick
lead pencil, easily seen, as much of the boundary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
of the stomach as I could at the end of each
expiration. Between the times for making the
drawings the cat was allowed to rest quietly on
a mat, but care was taken to lay her in the same
position on the holder for every drawing. The
drawings of each set were afterwards fastened
over one another, so that the lines coincided as
closely as possible. Another piece of tissue
paper was then put over these, and all four
sheets were laid on an illuminated pane of glass.
It was thus easy to get a composite tracing
which, considering the movement imparted to
the stomach by respiration, and the dimness of
the shadows in the later stages of digestion,
probably represents more exactly than any
single drawing the outline of the stomach for
each successive period.</p>

<p>A comparison of these drawings shows that
as digestion proceeds the antrum appears gradually
to elongate and acquire a greater capacity,
and that the constrictions make deeper indentations
in it. But when the fundus has lost most
of its contents, the longitudinal and circular
fibres of the antrum contract to make it again
shorter and smaller. Its change of form, however,
compared with the rest of the stomach,
is slight.</p>

<p>The first region to decrease markedly in size
is the preantral part of the pyloric portion. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
peristaltic undulations, caused by the circular
fibres, start at the beginning of this portion, and
gradually, by their rhythmic recurrence, press
some of the contents into the antrum. As the
process continues, the smooth muscle fibres with
their remarkable tonicity contract closely about
the food that remains, so that the middle region
comes to have the shape of a tube (Figs. 3 and 4&mdash;1.30
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>), with the rounded fundus
at one end and the active antrum at the other.
Along the tube very shallow constrictions may
be seen following one another to the pylorus.</p>

<p>At this juncture the longitudinal fibres which
cover the fundus like radiating fingers, and the
circular and oblique fibres reaching in all directions
about this spherical region, begin to
contract. Thus the contents of the fundus are
squeezed into the tubular portion. This process,
accompanied by a slight shortening of the
tube, goes on until the shadow cast by the
fundus is almost wholly obliterated (Fig. 5&mdash;5.30
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>).</p>

<p>The waves of constriction moving along the
tubular portion press the food onward as fast as
they receive it from the contracting fundus, and
when the fundus is at last emptied they sweep
the contents of the tube into the antrum (Fig. 5&mdash;5.00
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to 6.00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>). Here the operation
is continued by the deeper constrictions till,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
finally (in this instance at 6.12 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>), with the
exception of a slight trace of food in the fundus,
nothing is to be seen in the stomach at all.</p>

<p>The food in the fundus may possibly be
slightly affected by the to-and-fro movements
of the diaphragm in respiration. With normal
breathing the upper border of the cardiac portion
swings through about one centimetre; with
dyspnœa, or deep breathing, through one and a
half or two centimetres. Since the lower border
does not move so much, the contents are gently
pressed, and then released from pressure, at
each respiration. The pyloric portion is moved
very little by the diaphragm, the oscillation
being less than a half centimetre.</p>

<p>Moritz has pointed out the value of an organ
like the stomach for holding the bulk of the food
and serving it out a little at a time, so that the
intestines may not become congested during
their digestive and absorptive processes. All
of the advantages supposed to be thus secured
to the intestines may be claimed also for the
stomach itself. For the preceding description
indicates, and experiments to be described later
prove, that the stomach is composed of two
physiologically distinct portions: the busy antrum,
over which during digestion constriction-waves
are running in continuous rhythm; and
the cardiac part, which is an active reservoir,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
pressing out its contents a little at a time as the
antral mechanism is ready to receive them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Movements of the Stomach in
Vomiting</span></h4>

<p>The appearance of the stomach during vomiting
has been studied particularly by Openchowski.
He says that when an emetic is given
there follows a quivering of the stomach-wall,
which, beginning near the pylorus, shows itself
later in the antral and middle regions of the
stomach. The quivering afterwards passes into
a contraction, most strongly marked in the
antral part, since the peristaltic waves running
down to the antrum from above are continually
growing deeper. At the same time the fundus
expands spherically. The increased contraction
in the pyloric part drives the contents towards
the more dilated portion, and thence they
are forced into the œsophagus by abdominal
pressure.</p>

<p>The same phenomena occur when a cat is
given apomorphine hypodermatically. First the
upper circular muscles relax and become so
flaccid that the slightest movement of the
abdomen changes the form of the fundus. Then
there are apparently irregular twitchings of the
fundus wall. Soon a deep constriction starts
about three centimetres below the cardia and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
growing in strength, moves towards the pylorus.
When it reaches the transverse band the constriction
tightens and holds fast, while a wave
of contraction sweeps over the antrum. Another
similar constriction follows. In the interval the
transverse band relaxes slightly, but tightens
again when the second wave reaches it. Perhaps
a dozen such waves pass; then a firm
contraction at the beginning of the antrum completely
divides the gastric cavity into two parts.
This same division of the stomach into two parts
at the transverse band is to be seen when
mustard is given. Now, although the waves are
still running over the antrum, the whole preantral
part of the stomach is fully relaxed. A flattening
of the diaphragm and a quick jerk of the
abdominal muscles, accompanied by the opening
of the cardia, now force the contents of the
fundus into the œsophagus. As the spasmodic
contractions of the abdominal muscles are repeated,
the gastric wall again tightens around
the contained food. Antiperistalsis I have seen
only once; then, while the cat was retching, a
constriction started at the pylorus and ran back,
over the antrum, completely obliterating the
antral cavity.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the principal difference
between the movements of the stomach and
their effects as described by Beaumont, and Hof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>meister
and Schütz on the one hand, and Rossbach,
Roux and Balthazard, and myself on the
other hand, is that the former observed constrictions
completely dividing the stomach at the
transverse band, and the antrum then squeezing
its contents into the intestines; whereas the latter
have seen the constrictions moving forward as
narrowing rings, but not separating the gastric
cavity into two parts.</p>

<p>With the exception of peristalsis in the
antrum, the gastric movements at the beginning
of emesis are almost exactly the same as those
Beaumont, and Hofmeister and Schütz, declare
to be the normal contractions of the stomach.
Their observations were made, however, when
the organ was subjected to unnatural stimulation.
In the excised stomach, observed by Hofmeister
and Schütz, not only were all nervous connections
severed, but likewise all flow of blood
to the organ was entirely stopped, and the cutting
off of the blood supply is regarded as one of the
most powerful predisposing causes of peristaltic
action. The thermometer-tube used by Beaumont
was an irritant to the stomach, as he himself
admits. “If the bulb of the thermometer,”
he writes, “be suffered to be drawn down to the
pyloric extremity, and retained there for a short
time, or if the experiments be repeated too
frequently, it causes severe distress and a sen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>sation
like cramp, or spasm, which ceases on
withdrawing the tube, but leaves a sense of
soreness and tenderness at the pit of the
stomach.” Moritz also noticed that a rubber
sound introduced into the human stomach
proved to be a source of irritation. It seems
reasonable to suppose, therefore, that these observers
did not see the normal movements, but
the actions resulting from abnormal irritation.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Effect of the Movements of the
Stomach on the Food</span></h4>

<p>In my first observations on the active
stomach a bulging of the stomach-wall was to
be seen in front of the passing waves. But as
food did not immediately appear in the intestine,
and as, after the pylorus relaxed, the gastric
contents did not diminish rapidly enough to
allow the supposition that all of the food
squeezed forward by the waves was immediately
forced through the pylorus, it was assumed that
a part, at least, of the food under pressure was
forced back towards the cardia through the
constriction-ring. This inference was stated in
the preliminary notice of my work. Roux and
Balthazard also observed the passage of the undulations
over the pyloric part, but state merely
that the function of the constrictions is the
propulsion of food into the intestine, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
mentioning what must be regarded as a very
important function; namely, the mixing effect
of the waves.</p>

<p>Most writers have agreed that the result of
the active and passive movements of the stomach
is to force the contents hither and thither, thus
mixing them and the gastric juice together.
Two observers, Beaumont and Brinton, have attempted
to explain the manner of the mixing.
Beaumont, after noting how the thermometer-tube,
used by him to indicate the gastric motions,
was affected, describes the circulation of the food
as follows: “The bolus as it enters the cardia
turns to the left, passes the aperture, descends
into the splenic extremity, and follows the
great curvature towards the pyloric end. It
then returns, in the course of the small curvature,
makes its appearance again at the aperture,
in its descent into the great curvature, to perform
similar revolutions.” Brinton bases his
theory of the circulation of the food on an
analogy between the movement of a constriction
over the stomach and the passage of a septum
with a central perforation along the interior of a
cylinder full of liquid. The result in both cases,
he declares, must be a peripheral current of
advance, and a central current of return. Thus
in the stomach there would be peripheral currents
from the cardia along the walls of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
stomach to the pylorus, where they would unite
and run as an axial current back to the cardia.</p>

<p>Certain <i>a priori</i> objections may be urged
against each of these conclusions. In the first
place Beaumont’s observations were made on a
subject having a gastric fistula, and the adhesions
between the stomach and the abdominal wall
would prevent the fundus from acting quite
normally in relation to its contents. Beaumont’s
conclusions, furthermore, are based on the
movements of a thermometer-tube introduced
through the fistula, and on the recognition of
particles of food which he had seen before as
they passed the fistulous opening: the first
method, as has been shown, made the conditions
in the stomach more abnormal than they
were previously; the second gave uncertain
knowledge of the course of the food when out
of the observer’s sight. Brinton’s hypothesis
states the probable movements of fluid contents
acted on by a passing constriction. But it may
be objected that the conditions assumed by him
do not exist in all parts of the stomach. For
not only is there no peristalsis visible in the
fundus, but with the usual food the fundus
contents are not liquid. Moreover, the constrictions
at the beginning of the pyloric portion
are very slight and move slowly. The food in
front of them is, accordingly, not under much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
greater pressure than the food behind them.
The axial current which might result, therefore,
could not be strong enough to go far into the
cardiac portion.</p>

<p>It is easily possible to test experimentally
the validity of these two theories by watching
the action of pieces of food which throw a black
shadow in a dimly outlined stomach. For this
purpose little paste pellets of bismuth subnitrate,
with starch enough to keep the form, were
given with the customary meal. These pellets,
it was found, did not break up in the stomach
during the gastric digestion of soft bread. Several
times I have been fortunate in getting two
of the little balls in the axis of the stomach and
about a centimetre apart. As the constriction-wave
approached them, both moved forward,
but not so rapidly as the wave. Now when the
constriction overtook the first ball, the ball
moved backward through the constricted ring,
in the direction of least resistance. The wave
then overtook the second ball, and it also passed
backward to join its fellow. At the approach
of the next wave they were both pushed forward
once more, only to be again forced backward,
one at a time, through the narrow orifice. As
the waves recurred in their persistent rhythm,
the balls were seen to be making progress&mdash;an
oscillating progress&mdash;towards the pylorus;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
for they went forward each time a little farther
than they retreated. This to-and-fro movement
of the pellets was much more marked in the
antrum, where the waves were deep, than in the
middle region. On different occasions from
nine to twelve minutes have elapsed while the
balls were passing from where the waves first
affected them to the pylorus; which means that
on the way they were moved back and forth by
more than a half hundred constrictions.</p>

<p>If the pylorus does not relax, it is evident
that a wave approaching it pushes the food into
a blind, elastic pouch, the only exit from which
is through the advancing constricted ring. The
constrictions are deeper near the end of the
antrum, and the rings are small; consequently,
the food is squirted back through them with
considerable violence. As has been noted, the
pylorus opens less frequently for a while after a
solid piece of food comes to it. In such a case
the slow driving waves squeeze the hard morsel
and the soft food about it up to the sphincter,
only to have the whole mass shoot back, sometimes
half-way along the antrum. Over and
over again the process is repeated till the
sphincter at last opens and allows the more fluid
parts to pass. Hofmeister and Schütz, and
Moritz have disclaimed any selective action of the
pylorus, and declare that solids are driven from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
the pylorus to the fundus by antiperistalsis.
The action of the pylorus which I have seen,
however, is more like that described by the
earlier investigators; for during digestion there
was no antiperistalsis, and the sphincter, separating
the fluids from the solids, caused the solids
to remain and undergo a tireless rubbing.
Frequently, when several of these balls have
been given at the same time, they have all been
seen in the antrum after the stomach was otherwise
empty. Here they remain to be softened
in time by the juices, or to be forced through the
pylorus later, for solids do pass into the intestine.
Thus when the teeth neglect their work
the stomach attempts to perform their function;
the relative inefficiency of the gastric method of
grinding and its interference with the normal
gastric activities point an obvious hygienic
moral.</p>

<p>During the process of digestion the food in
the cardiac portion gives no sign of currents.
Balls which lie in the fundus immediately after
the food is ingested keep their relative positions
until the cardiac portion begins to contract, and
then move very slowly towards the antrum.
Moreover, the food in the fundus of a cat has
the same mushy appearance when examined
after gastric peristalsis had been active for an
hour and a half that it had when ingested. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
contents of the antrum, on the other hand, look
quite different and have the consistency of thick
soup. The inactivity of the food in the fundus
can also be proved by feeding first five grams
of bread and bismuth, then five grams without
bismuth, and finally five grams again with
bismuth in it. The stomach contents are thus
arranged in two dark layers along the curvatures,
with a light layer between. Tracings
made on tissue paper show that ten minutes
after peristalsis commenced the stratification
had entirely disappeared in the pyloric part, but
that an hour and twenty minutes thereafter the
layers were still clearly visible in the cardiac
region.</p>

<p>The value of the circulation of the food, as
described by Beaumont and Brinton, lay in the
supposition that the contents of the stomach
were thus brought near to the secreting gastric
wall, and that the gastric juice could thus more
readily exert its action. Although my observations
do not support their theories of mixing
currents running throughout the stomach, they
still show that the pyloric portion is an admirable
device for bringing all of the food under
the influence of the glandular secretions of that
region. For, when a constriction occurs, the
secreting surface enclosed by the ring is brought
close around the food lying within the ring in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
the axis of the stomach. As this constriction
passes on, fresh areas of glandular tissue are
continuously pressed in around the narrow orifice.
And also, as the constriction passes on,
a thin stream of gastric contents is continuously
forced back through the orifice, and thus past the
mouths of the glands. The result of this ingenious
mechanism is that every part of the secreting
surface of the pyloric portion is brought
near to every bit of food, before the latter leaves
the stomach, a half hundred times or more, as
evidence by the moving ball.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Salivary Digestion in the Stomach</span></h4>

<p>The absence of movement in the fundus
would seem to give the food during its stay there
little opportunity to become mixed with the
gastric juices, and thus to undergo peptic digestion.
The truth of this supposition can easily
be proved experimentally by feeding a slightly
alkaline meal, and later testing the chemical
reaction of the contents of various parts of the
stomach. A cat which had been without food
for fifteen hours was given eighteen grams of
mushy bread made slightly alkaline with sodium
carbonate. One hour and a half after the cat
had finished eating she was killed, and the
stomach laid bare by opening the abdomen. A
very small hole was then made through the wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
in the fundus region, and another similar hole
was made into the antrum. By means of a
glass pipette food was extracted first from the
periphery of the fundus; this food was slightly
acid. The cleaned pipette was then introduced
two and a half centimetres into the fundus contents,
and the food thus extracted gave the
original alkaline reaction. Specimens of the
liquid contents of the antral and middle regions,
taken from various depths, were all strongly
acid. A dog killed an hour and three-quarters
after eating showed similar differences between
the reactions of the food in the fundus and the
food in the pyloric portion. So, as a matter of
fact, the food does not become acid at a uniform
rate in all parts of the stomach, as would
be the case if Beaumont’s and Brinton’s theories
of mixing currents were true. Moreover, if the
facts accorded with their notions, the saliva,
which ceases to act in the presence of more than
0.003 per cent free hydrochloric acid, and is
destroyed when the percentage of acid proteids
is large, would manifestly have its service as a
ferment limited to the relatively short time during
which the stomach contents, in the process
of thorough mixing, were reaching that degree
of acidity. There is, however, no movement of
food in the fundus, and the alkaline food received
from the œsophagus remains alkaline in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
region for a considerable period. The nutriment,
therefore, if well chewed and thus mixed
with saliva, can undergo salivary digestion in
the fundus for a considerable period without
interference by the acid gastric juice.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>From all these observations the conclusion
must be that the fundus acts as a reservoir for
the food, in which the digestion of sugars and
starches may take place; and that the pyloric
portion with its simple but marvellous peristaltic
mechanism, by a single process, triturates the
food, brings it near to the active glands, stirs it
thoroughly with their secretions, and expels the
products into the intestines.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Inhibition of Stomach Movements
during Emotion</span></h4>

<p>Early in the research a marked unlikeness
was noticed in the action of the stomachs of male
and female cats. The peristalsis seen with only
a few exceptions in female cats failed to appear
in most of the males, although both had received
exactly the same treatment. Along with this difference
was a very striking difference in behaviour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
when bound to the holder; the females would
lie quiet, mewing occasionally, but purring as
soon as they were gently stroked. The males,
on the contrary, would fly into a violent rage,
struggle to be loose from their fastenings, bite
at everything near their heads, cry loudly, and
resist all attempts to quiet them. On account
of this difference only female cats were used for
some time, and the significance at first attributed
to the action of the males was almost forgotten
when the following incident recalled it
and suggested that the excitement caused the
suspension of the stomach movements. On
October 23, 1897, a male cat was fed at 12.00,
but was not placed on the holder till ninety
minutes later. The waves were passing at the
rate of six a minute. The cat fell into a rage
and the waves suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>A few days later an observation on a female
with kittens explained the absence of gastric
movements in the males. While the peristaltic
undulations were coursing regularly over the cat’s
stomach, she suddenly changed from her peaceful
sleepiness, began to breathe quickly, and
struggled to get loose. As soon as the change
took place, the movements in the stomach
entirely disappeared; the pyloric portion relaxed
and presented a smooth, rounded outline.
I continued observing, and stroked the cat reas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>suringly.
In a moment she became quiet and
began to purr. As soon as this happened the
movements commenced again in the stomach;
first a few constrictions were visible near the end
of the antrum, then a few near the sharp bend
in the lesser curvature, and finally the waves
were running normally from their habitual starting-place.
By holding the cat’s mouth closed
between the thumb and last three fingers, and
covering her nostrils with the index finger, she
could be kept from breathing. At the first sign
of discomfort the fingers were removed. This
experiment was repeated a great many times on
different cats, and invariably the evidence of
distress was accompanied by a total suspension
of the motor activities of the stomach and a
relaxation of the antral fibres.</p>

<p>No amount of kneading or compression of
the abdomen with the fingers, short of making
the cat angry, would cause the waves to stop;
so that the cat’s movements, in themselves,
were not the source of the inhibition. And
since expressions of strong feeling on the part
of the animal always accompanied cessation of
the constriction-waves, the inhibition was probably
due to nervous influence. It has long
been common knowledge that violent emotions
interfere with the digestive process, but that the
gastric motor activities should manifest such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
extreme sensitiveness to nervous conditions is
surprising.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>1. By mixing a harmless powder, subnitrate
of bismuth, with the food, the movements of the
stomach can be seen by means of the Röntgen
rays.</p>

<p>2. The stomach consists of two physiologically
distinct parts: the pyloric part and the
fundus. Over the pyloric part, while food is
present, constriction-waves are seen continually
coursing towards the pylorus; the fundus is an
active reservoir for the food and squeezes out
its contents gradually into the pyloric part.</p>

<p>3. The stomach is emptied by the formation,
between the fundus and the antrum, of a tube
along which constrictions pass. The contents
of the fundus are pressed into the tube and the
tube and antrum slowly cleared of food by the
waves of constriction.</p>

<p>4. The food in the pyloric portion is first
pushed forward by the running wave, and then
by pressure of the stomach-wall is returned
through the ring of constriction; thus the food
is thoroughly mixed with gastric juice, and is
forced by an oscillating progress to the pylorus.</p>

<p>5. The food in the fundus is not moved by
peristalsis, and consequently it is not mixed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
the gastric juice; salivary digestion can therefore
be carried on in this region for a considerable
period without being stopped by the acid
gastric juice.</p>

<p>6. The pylorus does not open at the approach
of every wave, but only at irregular intervals.
The arrival of a hard morsel causes the sphincter
to open less frequently than normally, thus
materially interfering with the passage of the
already liquefied food.</p>

<p>7. Solid food remains in the antrum to be
rubbed by the constrictions until triturated, or
to be softened by the gastric juice, or later
it may be forced into the intestine in the solid
state.</p>

<p>8. The constriction-waves have, therefore,
three functions: the mixing, trituration, and
expulsion of the food.</p>

<p>9. At the beginning of vomiting, the gastric
cavity is separated into two parts by a constriction
at the entrance to the antrum; the cardiac
portion is relaxed, and the spasmodic contractions
of the abdominal muscles force the food
through the opened cardia into the œsophagus.</p>

<p>10. The stomach movements are inhibited
whenever the cat shows signs of anxiety, rage,
or distress.</p>

<p>The investigation of intestinal movements
has been beset by the same difficulties that
characterised the investigation of the gastric
mechanism. Pathological subjects or animals
subjected to the disturbing action of drugs and
anæsthetics and of serious operations have been
the only sources of our knowledge. A considerable
difference of opinion as to the nature of
the normal movements in the intestines has
resulted from observations made under these
necessary abnormal conditions. The slowly
advancing peristaltic wave and the <i>Pendelbewegung</i>,
or swaying movement, described by
Ludwig, have been regarded as true physiological
processes. Concerning antiperistalsis and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
the swiftly running vermicular contraction, observers
are not so nearly in agreement. The
activity of the large intestine has been described
as simply peristalsis of a slower rate than that
seen in the small intestine.</p>

<p>The best known of the intestinal movements
is the normal peristaltic wave. This wave is
slow, having a rate of about two centimetres
per minute, is regular, and by most observers
is said to move always in one direction. The
progress of the contraction, as suggested by
Nothnagel’s experiments, and as clearly stated
by Mall and by Bayliss and Starling, is dependent
upon a local reflex. According to Mall, when
an object stimulates the mucosa there occurs
above the point of stimulation a constriction
which forces the object downward; and as
it moves downward new regions immediately
above the mass are by this reflex brought into
constriction, and thus the wave and its stimulus
advance together. “At the same time,” Mall
states, “a sucking force, due to active dilatation
below the body, may have a tendency to drag
it down.” In what manner an active dilatation
of the intestinal wall may occur so as to produce
a “sucking force” he does not make
wholly clear. Bayliss and Starling, in describing
normal peristalsis in the intestine, state that
the contractions above the bolus increase until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
there is a strong tonic constriction. This passes
the bolus onward, and as it advances the ring
of constriction follows it. While the bolus is
passing down, the gut above it is traversed by
waves running as far as the constricted ring.
These observers state the law of intestinal peristalsis
thus: “Local stimulation of the gut produces
excitation above and inhibition below the
excited spot.”</p>

<p>The pendulum movements are characterised
by a gentle swaying motion of the coils, and are
accompanied by rhythmical contractions of the
intestinal wall. They continue with undiminished
force after paralysis of the local nervous
mechanism by nicotine or cocaine; they have
been called, therefore, myogenic or myodromic
contractions. Observers have described them
variously as shortenings and narrowings of the
gut, rhythmically repeated at nearly the same
intestinal circumference; as alternating to-and-fro
movements of the long axis without changes
in the lumen; as local or extensive periodic
contractions and relaxations mainly of the circular
musculature; and as waves involving both
muscular coats of the intestine, and travelling
normally from above downward at a rapid rate
(2 to 5 cm. per second). They have been seen
in the dog, and in the rabbit and cat. In the
cat Bayliss and Starling noticed that when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
lumen of the gut was distended by a rubber
balloon, there appeared rhythmical contractions,
which nearly always were most marked at about
the middle of the balloon; <i>i. e.</i>, the region of
greatest tension. This form of constriction,
which, as my observation shows, is an indication
of the manner in which the rhythmical contraction
acts in the cat’s intestine, Bayliss and Starling
seem to have regarded with slight attention,
since it did not accord with the law of peristalsis.</p>

<p>The swift vermicular wave may pass the
whole length of the intestine in about a minute.
It is often seen just after death, as well as in
pathological states such as intestinal anæmia or
hyperæmia, and when the bowel contains gases
and organic acids from decomposing food.
Starling is inclined to regard this type of intestinal
activity as an exaggeration of the rhythmic
type; Mall, on the other hand, places it in
a class by itself, and declares that its service
is to rid the intestine rapidly of irritating substances.
Nothnagel, who designates this form
of movement with the term <i>Rollbewegung</i>, thinks
it is transitional between a physiological and a
pathological activity.</p>

<p>The existence of antiperistalsis has been so
much questioned that it will be considered in a
special section of this paper, where my observations
may be conveniently introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>The common understanding of the manner
in which food passes through the intestinal
canal is that the chyme ejected from the stomach
is pressed downward by a peristalsis, which
passes slowly over a part or all of the small intestine.
The peristaltic waves of the colon are
supposed to constitute an independent group,
similar to those of the small intestine, but
weaker and slower. Movements of the food
other than the uninterrupted advance have been
mentioned by some observers. Starling states
that the effect of the pendulum movement is
to mix the contents of the intestine and bring
them into intimate contact with the mucous
membrane. Grützner writes that he has been
brought “by strange and peculiar observations”
to believe that the fluid contents of the
small intestine move irregularly forward, then
forward and back, then perhaps remain quiet
for some time, only to pass backward for a long
distance, and finally to move forward steadily to
the end. In this manner the food is mixed and
brought into contact with the absorbing walls.
The to-and-fro shiftings of the food Grützner
ascribed to advancing and retrograde contractions
of the intestinal musculature, and he
argued that even circular constrictions must
force the liquid contents away in both directions.
To support his contention, Grützner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
introduced mercury into the intestine and observed
it with the Röntgen rays. After noting
a backward and forward movement of the mercury
he dismissed the method, saying, “Many
a flash must come from the Röntgen tube before
the <i>normal</i> movement of the intestinal contents
is made entirely clear by this method.”</p>

<p>The following account is a summary of many
repeated observations on different animals, and
is a contribution to a clear understanding of the
normal movements of the intestines and their
contents.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Movements of the Small Intestine</span></h4>

<p>When the food has been distributed through
the intestine so as to present the appearance
shown in Figure 1, a noticeable feature in most
or all of the loops is the total absence of movement.
If the animal remains quiet, however,
only a few moments elapse before peculiar
motions appear in one or another of the loops,
or perhaps in several, and last for some time.
These motions consist in a sudden division of
one of the long, narrow masses of food into
many little segments of nearly equal size; then
these segments are again suddenly divided and
the neighbouring halves unite to make new segments,
and so on, in a manner to be more fully
described. I have called this process the rhyth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>mic
segmentation of the intestinal contents.
Further observation reveals peristalsis here and
there, and under certain circumstances the
typical swaying movements may be seen. All
these phenomena are
now to be considered
in detail.</p>

</div>


<p><i>Rhythmic segmentation
of the intestinal
contents.</i>&mdash;This is by
far the most common
and the most interesting
mechanical process
to be seen in the small
intestine. The nature
of the process may
best be understood by
referring to the diagram
in Figure 2. A
string-like mass of food
is seen lying quietly in
one of the intestinal loops (line 1, Fig. 2). Suddenly
an undefined activity appears in the mass,
and a moment later constrictions at regular intervals
along its length cut it into little ovoid
pieces. The solid string is thus quickly transformed,
by a simultaneous sectioning, into a
series of uniform segments. A moment later
each of these segments is divided into two par<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>ticles,
and immediately after the division neighbouring
particles (as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, line 2, Fig. 2) rush
together, often with the rapidity of flying shuttles,
and merge to form new segments (as <i>c</i>, line
3, Fig. 2). The next moment these new segments
are divided, and neighbouring particles
unite to make a third series, and so on. At
the time of the second segmentation (line 3,
Fig. 2) the end particles are left small. Observation
shows that these small pieces are not redivided.
The end piece at A simply varies in
size with each division; at one moment it is left
small, at the next moment it is full size from the
addition of a part of the nearest segment, and a
moment later is the small bit left after another
division. The end piece at B (probably the rear
of the mass) shoots away when the end mass is
divided, and is swept back at each reunion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
make the large end mass again, only to be shot
away and swept onward with each recurrence of
the constrictions. Thus the process of repeated
segmentation continues, with the little particles
flitting towards each other and the larger segments
shifting to and fro, commonly for more
than half an hour without cessation. From the
beginning to the end of a period of segmentation
the food is seen to have changed its position
in the abdomen to only a slight extent;
whether this change is a passing of the food
along the loop, or a movement of the loop
itself, it is impossible to tell from the shadows
on the screen. The change of position, however,
is much less conspicuous than the lively
division and redivision which the mass suffers so
many times from the busy, shifting constrictions.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Diagram representing the process of rhythmic segmentation.
Lines 1, 2, 3, 4 indicate the sequence of appearances
in the loop. The dotted lines mark the regions of division. The
arrows show the relation of the particles to the segments they
subsequently form.</div>
</div>

<p>From this typical form of rhythmic segmentation
there are several variations. Sometimes,
and especially when the mass of food is thick,
the constrictions do not make complete divisions
and are so far apart that the intermediate
portions are relatively large. Moreover, the
constrictions do not take place in the middle of
each portion, but near one end; thus each
portion is constricted, not into halves, but into
thirds. If a little pointer is placed at the middle
of a segment, when the segments are completely
divided into halves, in a few seconds the pointer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
will be in the middle of the clear space between
two segments; but in a few seconds more the
first phase will return and the pointer will again
be indicating a segment,&mdash;two operations intervene
between similar phases. When, however,
the portions are constricted into thirds, the indicator
shows it, since three operations intervene
between similar phases. The manner of these
changes is made clearer by reference to the
diagram in Figure 3. That each portion is constricted
into three pieces is proved also by
watching the gradual reduction of the portion
at the left end of line 1 through lines 2 and 3,
and also in the gradual formation of a full-sized
portion at the right end of lines 2, 3, and 4.
When food undergoing this process is watched,
it appears to be affected by a series of constrictions,
each of which starts at one end of the
mass and marches through to the other end,
leaving its impress at short intervals along the
length. The progression of the dotted lines
from right to left in <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, etc., Fig. 3,
gives a notion of these advancing constrictions.</p>

<p>Another variation of the segmentation is
shown in Figure 4. In this type there are evidently
divisions and subdivisions, <i>i.e.</i>, one more
operation between the appearance and the reappearance
of the same phase than is present in
the simple division of the small segments in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
long string of food (Fig. 2). This form of
segmentation is fairly typical for the constrictions
seen in food advancing through the intestine.
Sometimes the divisions occur in the middle of
a long string of food and leave the ends wholly
unaffected.</p>

<div class="figright illowp60" id="illus-390" style="max-width: 18.75em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing the relations
of the portions when they are constricted
into three pieces. The dotted lines indicate
regions of constriction; the arrows indicate
the relationship of the pieces to the
portions they subsequently form.</div>
</div>

<p>A remarkable feature in the segmentation of
the food is the rapidity with which the changes
take place.
The simplest
way of estimating
the rate of
division is to
count, not the
number of
times the partition
of the food
recurs in the
same place,
but the number
of different
sets of segments observed in a given period.
Thus in Figure 4 the appearances of lines 1, 2,
3, 4, etc., would be counted, and not merely lines
1, 4, etc. Repeated observations on different
animals have shown that the most common
rate of division in long, thin chains of food
varies between twenty-eight and thirty times in
a minute; <i>i. e.</i>, there is a change from one set of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
segments to another set every two seconds, and
a return of the same phase every four seconds.
In some cases the rate is as low as twenty-three
times per minute. The larger masses seem to
be associated with a slower segmentation; the
operations indicated in Figure 3, for example,
occurred from eighteen to twenty-one times in a
minute, so that the same phase reappeared only
once in eight or nine seconds. The segmentation
frequently continues for more than half
an hour; in one instance it was seen to persist
with only three short periods of inactivity for
two hours and twenty-two minutes. At the
rate of thirty segmentations per minute it is
clear that a slender string of food may commonly
undergo division into small particles
more than a thousand times while scarcely
changing its position in the intestine.</p>

<p>I have seen once, in a cat only lightly etherised,
the exterior of an intestine which was
dividing the food as above described. An hour
and a half after a meal of salmon the anæsthetic
was given, the abdomen opened, and the flaps
raised so as to form walls. Warm salt solution
was then poured into the abdominal cavity, and
the floating coils left covered with the transparent
omentum. The gastric peristaltic waves
were running regularly; on the intestine there
were visible at various places during the period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
of observation regions of constriction which had
the appearance shown in Figure 3, except that
the rings were relatively nearer together. New
rings of constriction took place on the same side
of all the bulging parts at the margin of the
constricted portion (<i>cf.</i> dotted lines, Fig. 3). As
new rings occurred the old relaxed, but apparently
with tardiness, for the contents gurgled as
if forced through the narrowed lumen. The
constrictions recurred irregularly and at much
longer intervals than in the normal animal. The
contracted rings were pale and bloodless.</p>

<p>The effect of the process of rhythmic segmentation
proves it an admirable mechanism.
The food over and over again is brought into
closest contact with the intestinal walls by the
swift kneading movement of the muscles.
Thereby not only is the undigested food intimately
mixed with the digestive juices, but the
digested food is thoroughly exposed to the organs
of absorption. Mall has shown that contraction
of the intestinal wall has the effect of
pumping the blood from the submucous venous
plexus into the radicles of the superior mesenteric
vein, and thus materially aids the intestinal
circulation. Moreover, lacteals loaded with fat
will in a few moments become empty unless
the intestine is slit lengthwise, so that the muscles
cannot exert compression. The rhythmic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
constrictions, therefore, both propel the blood in
the portal circulation and act like a heart in promoting
the flow of lymph in the lacteals. This
single movement with its several results is an excellent
example of bodily economy; the repeated
constrictions, as already shown, thoroughly churn
the food and digestive fluids together, and also
plunge the absorbing mucosa into the very
midst of the food masses: but not only are the
processes of digestion and absorption favoured
by these movements; they also, by compression
of the veins and lacteals of the intestinal
wall, serve to deport through blood and lymph
channels the digested and absorbed material.</p>

<p><i>Peristalsis.</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;The phenomena of peristalsis
and segmentation are usually combined in some
manner while the food passes through the small
intestine. Peristalsis is observed normally in
two forms: as a slow advancing of the food for
a short distance in a coil, and as a rapid movement
sweeping the food without pause through
several turns of the gut. The latter form is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
frequently seen when the food is carried on from
the duodenum; and it may readily be produced
in other parts of the small intestine by giving an
enema of soapsuds.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp35" id="illus-394" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img src="images/illus-394.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;Diagram
showing combined peristalsis and segmentation.</div>
</div>

<p>When a mass of food has been subjected for
some time to the segmenting activity of the
intestine, the separate segments, instead of
being again divided, may suddenly begin to
move slowly along the loop in which they lie.
That this movement is not a
swinging of the coil as a whole,
but a peristaltic advance of separate
rings of its circular musculature,
is made probable by the fact
that the succeeding segments follow
along the same path their
predecessors have taken. The
advance of the little pieces may
continue for seven or eight centimetres,
when finally the front piece stops or meets
other food. Then all the succeeding pieces are
swept one by one into the accumulating mass,
which at last lies stretched along the intestine, a
solid string manifesting no sign of commotion.</p>

<p>Another form of slow peristalsis is frequently
observed when the food is pushed forward, not
in small divisions, but as a large lump. The
relatively long string of food is first crowded into
an ovoid form as the forward movement begins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
and as it is collecting thus, it seems at the last
to be suddenly formed into a more rounded
ball, as if the mass were pulled or pushed together
at the two ends. The next moment it is
indented in the middle by a circular constriction
(as shown in Fig. 4, line 2), which spreads it in
both directions along the loop. The trailing
portion (<i>a</i>) is next cut in two, and the severed
part sometimes flies back over its course about
a centimetre. Now the whole mass is swept
together again and slightly forward as shown in
line 4, Fig. 4, and the segmenting process is
repeated. At stage 3, Fig. 4, a constriction
sometimes appears around the middle of the
advanced portion (<i>b</i>). Thus, with many halts
and interruptions, the food slowly advances.</p>

<p>A slight variation of the movement just described
is observed when the amount of food is
greater and extends farther along the intestine.
Under such circumstances, as the mass moves forward,
constrictions appear just in front of the rear
end, which separate it from the main body, and
cause it to shoot backward sometimes through
the distance of a centimetre. The main body
meanwhile is not disturbed. No sooner has the
rear section been shot away than it is swept forward
again into union with the rest of the food,
and the whole mass then advances until another
interfering constriction repeats the process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p><i>Rhythmic segmentation and the pendulum
movement.</i>&mdash;There is little doubt that the segmentation
of the food which I have seen is due
to an activity of the intestinal musculature similar
to that which causes the so-called pendulum
movement. This activity, as already noted, is
rhythmic, and, although accounts differ, analytical
methods prove that it involves both the
longitudinal and the circular layers of muscle.
Observations of the effect of the rhythmic contractions
upon the food show that the action of
the circular fibres is most prominent. It is
probable, however, that the longitudinal fibres
also play an important part in the process of
segmentation. Examination of Figure 2 makes
clear that in line 2 the regions of constriction
appear between the regions of constriction in
line 3; before <i>c</i> can be formed, therefore, the
constriction between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> must relax. Contraction
of the longitudinal fibres between two
segments would help to enlarge the constricted
lumen of the gut. It seems probable that, as
the constrictions on either side of <i>c</i> occur, the
longitudinal fibres between them contract; almost
simultaneously the constriction between
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> relaxes, and the two particles are thus
brought swiftly together. A similar process
naturally would take place for each of the shifting
segments. Thus the function of the longi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>tudinal
muscles would be to contract between
new rings of constriction and thereby aid in
relaxing the former ring between them. During
my one observation of the segmenting process,
as seen on the surface of the intestine, I could
not be sure that the distance between neighbouring
segments was shortened as the constriction
relaxed; that activity of the
longitudinal fibres is present,
however, is indicated by observations
of Raiser on the intestines
of the rabbit and the cat.
Raiser observed the outer surface
of the coils, and describes
the normal movement as an
alternate contraction and relaxation
of single divisions of the
longitudinal fibres; he notes
that these short divisions shift.
But whether they shift in alternation with the
shifting circular constrictions, as seems probable,
is an interesting point not yet determined.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 5.</span>&mdash;Tracing
showing segmentation of chyme in the duodenum. This
and other tracings reduced two-thirds.</div>
</div>

<p>Bayliss and Starling state that the swaying
pendulum movements are essentially due to
peristaltic waves recurring in the same place
and running rapidly downward. This form of
the movements I have seen only once. At this
time about 90 c.c. of soapy water had been injected.
This procedure has the effect of exag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>gerating
in every particular the movements of
the small intestine. In this instance a broad
constriction appeared about the middle of a
long string of food and persisted there while
it spread down the gut. As the contraction
spread, the gut swayed slowly to and fro before it.
Then there was a relaxation, followed by a recurrence
of the constriction in the same place,
a spreading of the contraction, and a swinging
of the loop just as before. This phenomenon
was repeated again and again, till finally the
string was divided and the forward piece pushed
through a tortuous course to the colon.</p>

<p><i>The course of the food in the small intestine.</i>&mdash;Chyme
is not forced from the stomach by
every wave that passes over the antrum, but
only at intervals. When the pylorus relaxes, the
food, moved towards the pylorus under considerable
pressure, is squirted along the duodenum for
two centimetres or more. Careful watching of
this food shows that usually it lies for some time
in the curve of the duodenum until additions have
been made to it from the stomach, and a long,
thin string of food is formed. While it is resting
in this place it is exposed to the outpouring
of the bile and pancreatic juices. All at once
the string becomes segmented (see Fig. 5) and
the process of rhythmic segmentation continues
several minutes, thoroughly mixing the intes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>tinal
digestive juices with the chyme. In this
region the alternate positions of the segments
are sometimes far apart, and the to-and-fro
movements of the particles may be a relatively
extensive and very energetic swinging. Finally
the little segments unite into a single mass, or
form in groups, and begin to move forward.
The peristalsis here, as already mentioned, is
much more rapid than the normal peristalsis
elsewhere in the small intestine. The masses,
once started, go flying along, turning curves,
whisking hither and thither in the loops, moving
swiftly and continuously forward. After passing
on in this rapid manner for some distance
the food is collected in thicker and longer strings,
resembling the strings seen characteristically in
the other loops. Towards the end of digestion
the small masses shot out from the stomach,
after a few segmentations, may move on in the
rapid course without being accumulated in a
larger mass until the swift movement ceases.</p>

<p>During the first stages of digestion in the
cat’s small intestine the food usually lies chiefly
on the right side of the abdomen; during the
last stages the loops on the left side contain
the greater amount of food. In these loops
the food remains sometimes for an hour or more
with no sign of movement. All at once a mass
begins to show irregular depressions and eleva<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>tions
along its length, and then suddenly it is
divided, at first partially, later completely, into
many little equal parts, and these repeatedly
undergo division and reunion, division and reunion,
over and over again, in the manner
described above as rhythmic segmentation.
After a varying length of time the activity
wanes and the little segments are carried forward
individually and later brought together,
or join and move on as a single body, or they
may reunite and lie quietly for some time without
further change. Thus by a combined
process of kneading and peristaltic advance the
food is brought to the ileocæcal valve to enter
the large intestine. Records from ten different
animals show that salmon does not appear in
the small intestine until an hour or an hour and
a half after the food is eaten. Inasmuch as five
or six hours elapse after eating before this food
begins to be seen in the colon, it is evident that
the chyme takes four to five hours to pass the
length of the small intestine. It is interesting
to note that the operations are considerably
shortened if the meal has consisted of bread and
milk.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Competence of the Ileocæcal Valve</span></h4>

<p>The ileocæcal valve in the cat is situated
three or four centimetres from the blind end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
the cæcum. Its position is usually marked in
shadows of the food in the colon by a slight
indentation, towards which masses about to enter
the colon are ordinarily directed from a point
somewhat distant in the small intestine (see
Fig. 6).</p>

<p>Regarding the competence of the ileocæcal
valve many observations have been made.
Grützner has reviewed the evidence bearing on
the question and concludes that the valve is not
competent, least of all for liquids. He declares
that as soon as liquids or thin fluid masses appear
in the upper part of the colon they pass
in many instances into the small intestine the
moment that the pressure on the colon side
rises slightly. If the colon contains a solid or
a thick, mushy mass, the passage towards the
small intestine is scarcely possible, because
every increase of pressure in the large intestine
must force the two lips of the valve together
and close it.</p>

<p>The importance of the competence of the
ileocæcal valve under normal conditions cannot
be appreciated until the function of the first
part of the colon is considered. In order that
this part of the intestinal mechanism may perform
its service, the competence of the valve
for the food which enters the colon from the
ileum should be perfect. As a matter of fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
such is the case. Not only does the activity of
the colon prove this statement, but the failure
of every attempt to drive the food in the colon
back through the valve into the ileum confirms
the proof. Again and again I have tried, by
manipulation through the abdominal wall, to
press the normal contents of the colon downward
with sufficient force to cause them to return
to the small intestine, but without success.
The valve held perfectly.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Movements of the Large Intestine</span></h4>

<p>When the large intestine is full, palpation
through the abdominal wall demonstrates that
the material in the lower descending colon and
in the sigmoid flexure is usually composed of
hard, incompressible lumps, while that in the
ascending and transverse colon and the cæcum
is soft, permitting the walls of the gut to be
easily pushed together. The condition of the
contents in these two regions seems to indicate
a rough division of the large intestine into two
parts, and the mechanical activities of these two
parts verify the differentiation. In the descending
colon the material is very slowly advanced
by rings of tonic constrictions (see Fig. 7); in
the ascending and transverse colon and in the
cæcum by far the most common movement is
an antiperistalsis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span></p>

<p><i>Antiperistalsis in the colon.</i>&mdash;The colon of
cats which have been without food for a day
usually contains enough gas to make the position
of the gut distinguishable with the fluorescent
screen (see Fig. 1). The first food to
enter the colon from the small intestine is carried
by antiperistaltic waves into the cæcum
(Fig. 1), and all new food as it enters is also
affected by these waves. Thus the contents of
the colon, instead of being driven immediately
toward the rectum by slow peristalsis, as is the
general opinion, are first repeatedly pushed
toward the cæcum by an antiperistaltic action.</p>

<p>These antiperistaltic waves follow one after
another like the peristaltic waves of the stomach
(see Figs. 5, 6, and 10). They begin either on
the more advanced portion of the food in the
colon (when only a small amount is present), or
at the nearest tonic constriction, which is usually
at the turn between the transverse and descending
colon (Figs. 7 and 8.) The waves rarely
run continuously for a long time. When the
colon is full, it is usually quiet. The first sign
of activity is an irregular undulation of the
walls, then very faint constrictions passing along
the gut towards the cæcum. These constrictions
may first appear only on the ascending colon.
As they continue coursing over the intestine
they become deeper and deeper, until there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
a marked bulging between successive constrictions.
When the waves have thus become
more prominent, they are seen to start near the
end of the transverse colon and pass without
interruption to the end of the cæcum. After
these deepest waves have been running for a
few minutes the indentations grow gradually
less marked, until at last they are so faint as to
be hardly discernible. The final waves are
sometimes to be observed only at the end of
the transverse colon.</p>

<p>Such a period of antiperistalsis lasts from
two to eight minutes, with an average duration
of four or five minutes. The periods recur at
varying lengths of time; in one instance a period
began at 1.38 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and was repeated at 2.06,
2.34, 2.55, 3.15, and at 3.36, when the observation
ceased; in another instance a period
began at 2.43 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and was repeated at 2.57
and at intervals of from ten to fifteen minutes
thereafter while the animal was being watched.
The waves have nearly the same rate of recurrence
as those in the stomach; about five and
a half waves pass a given point in a minute, <i>i. e.</i>,
eleven waves in two minutes. This rate has
proved fairly constant in different cats and at
different stages in the process of digestion; in
one case, however, the waves passed at the rate
of nine in two minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span></p>

<p>The stimulating effect of rectal injections on
the movements of the small intestine has already
been noted. Enemata have also pronounced
stimulating action on the antiperistalsis of the
colon. Usually the almost immediate result of
a rectal injection of warm water is the appearance
of deep antiperistaltic waves, which often
continue running for a long period. In one
case, after an injection of 50 c.c. of warm water,
the waves followed one another with monotonous
regularity during an observation lasting
an hour and twenty minutes. The manner in
which this antiperistaltic mechanism affects
nutrient enemata introduced into the bowel will
be discussed in the section devoted to the
question of antiperistalsis.</p>

<p>These constrictions passing backward over
the colon do not force the normal contents
back through the valve into the small intestine
again. I have seen hundreds of such constrictions,
and only twice have there been exceptions
to this rule,&mdash;once under normal conditions,
when a small mass slipped back into the ileum,
and at another time when a large amount of
water had been introduced into the colon. The
importance of the competence of the ileocæcal
valve is now apparent; indeed, antiperistalsis
in the colon gives new meaning and value to the
location of a valve at the opening of the ileum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
For, inasmuch as the valve is normally competent,
the constrictions repeatedly coursing
towards it force the food before them into a blind
sac. The effect on the food must be the same
as the effect seen in the stomach when the
pylorus remains closed before the advancing
waves. The food is pressed forward by the
approach of each constriction; but since it cannot
go onward in the blind sac, and is, moreover,
subjected to increasing pressure as the
constriction comes nearer, it is forced into the
only way of escape, <i>i. e.</i>, away from the cæcum
through the advancing constricted ring. About
twenty-five waves affect every particle of food
in the colon in this manner during each normal
period of antiperistalsis. The result must be
again a thorough mixing of the contents and a
bringing of these contents into close contact
with the absorbing wall&mdash;a process which has
already been variously repeated many times in
the stomach and in the small intestine.</p>

<p>Two other movements have been observed
in the ascending colon, but they are rare appearances.
The first of these was a serial sectioning
of the contents noticed in an animal
given castor oil with the food. A constriction
separated a small segment in the cæcum; another
constriction then cut off a segment just
above the first, and with the disappearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
the first constriction the two separated segments
united. A third segmentation took place
above the second, and the changes occurred
again. Thus the whole mass was sectioned
from one end to the other; and no sooner was
that finished than the process began again and
was repeated several times. A slight modification
of this movement was observed in a colon
containing very little food. The mass was
pressed and partially segmented in the manner
characteristic of the small intestine, and was
thus again and again spread along the ascending
colon, and each time swept back into a
rounded form by antiperistalsis. The second
of the two movements mentioned above consisted
in a gentle kneading of the contents.
This was caused by broad constrictions appearing,
relaxing, appearing, relaxing, over and
over again, in the same place. When several of
these regions were active at the same time,
they gave the food in the colon the appearance
of a restless undulatory mass. Once a constriction
occurred and remained permanently in one
place, while the bulging parts on either side of
it pulsated alternately, at the rate of about
eighteen times in a minute, with the regularity
of the heart-beat. Although these phenomena
are somewhat striking, they are not usual, and
are in no way so important as the antiperistalsis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span></p>

<p><i>The changes when food enters the colon.</i>&mdash;The
passage of food through the ileocæcal
valve seems to stimulate the colon to activity.
As food is nearing the ileocæcal valve the large
intestine is usually quiet and relaxed (Fig. 6,
4.00), though occasionally indefinite movements
are to be observed; and sometimes just before
the food reaches the end of the ileum the circular
fibres of the colon in the region of the
valve contract strongly, so that a deep indentation
is present there. The indentation may
persist several minutes; it disappears as the
muscles relax just previous to the entrance of
the food. The food is moved slowly along the
ileum and is pushed through the valve into the
colon. The moment it has entered a strong
contraction takes place all along the cæcum and
the beginning of the ascending colon, pressing
some of the food onward, and a moment later
deep antiperistaltic waves (Fig. 6, 4.03) sweep
down from the transverse colon and continue
running until the cæcum is again normally full,
<i>i. e.</i>, for two or three minutes.</p>

4.00, the colon relaxed as food approaches
in the ileum. 4.03, the
colon contracted and traversed by
antiperistaltic waves after the food
has entered.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The appearance of tonic constrictions.</i>&mdash;It has
already been noted that as the food accumulates
in the ascending colon it is at first confined to
this region by antiperistaltic waves. With further
accessions, however, the contents naturally
must be pressed more and more into the trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>verse
and descending colon. In the early stages
of this accumulation, while the food lies chiefly
in the ascending colon, the only activity of the
muscular walls is the antiperistalsis. As the
contents extend along the intestine a deep constriction
appears near the advancing end and
nearly separates a globular mass from the main
body of the food (Fig. 6). The contents of the
large intestine progress
farther and
farther from the
cæcum; meanwhile
new tonic constrictions
appear which
separate the contents
into a series
of globular masses.
And as the number
of these divisions increases
they take a
position farther from the cæcum, so that they are
present chiefly in the descending colon (Fig. 7).
Raiser has recorded a similar appearance in the
terminal portion of the rabbit’s colon, in which
deep circular constrictions separate the scybalous
masses. He maintains that these masses are
pushed onward by the constrictions. Comparing
tracings made at rather long intervals (forty-five
minutes), I found that the rings disappear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
from the transverse colon, and then are present
with the waste material in the descending colon.
Thus in the cat also these rings, which seem with
short observation to be remaining in one position,
are in reality moving slowly away from the
cæcum, pushing the hardening
contents before
them. The contents at
this stage are no longer
fluid, and consequently
they must offer considerable
resistance to a force
pushing them through the
colon. It is an advantage
to have this pultaceous
substance propelled in
divisions rather than in
a uniformly cylindrical
mass, since the fibres
along the length of the
mass are thereby rendered
effective. Such are
the functions of the persistent
rings; they form the waste matter into
globular masses at the end of the transverse
colon and slowly push these masses onward.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 7.</span>&mdash;Radiograph
showing the region of tonic constrictions (descending
colon) and the region of antiperistalsis (transverse
and ascending colon).</div>
</div>

<p>In the transverse colon, which is free from
the slowly moving rings, the antiperistaltic
waves have full sway. In the region of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
tonic rings an infrequent or even a slowly periodic
relaxation and contraction are often to be
observed. These changes seem to take place
in all the rings at about the same time. Once
I saw antiperistaltic waves running over the
uppermost of four segments, but since the
rings on either side of the segment held tightly,
the waves had merely the effect of churning the
material of the segment and did not move it
onward. Inasmuch as the material in these
segments at first is soft, so that the segments
are easily compressible, while the fæcal masses
which are the final result are relatively hard and
dry, it follows that even within the confines of
these persistent rings some absorption is taking
place.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Defecation</span></p>

<p>The process of clearing the colon is a process
of repeated reduction of the amount of
material present. Figure 8 (3.11) is a radiograph
showing the food in the colon at 3.11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
About 3.25, with a slow, sweeping movement,
the gut swung around so that the ascending
colon was lying in the position of the last half
of the transverse colon, and the transverse colon
had taken the position of the descending part
(Fig. 8, 3.25). At the same time the tonic constrictions
disappeared and were replaced by a
strong, broad contraction of the circular mus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>cle,
tapering the contents off on either side in
two cones. The region of strongest contraction
was apparently drawn downward with the rest
of the gut by a shortening of the descending
colon. As the intestine swung around, more
material was forced into the rectum, and when
the swinging of the intestine stopped, the constriction
which divided the lumen passed slowly
downward, and with the aid of the muscles surrounding
the abdominal cavity, pushed the separated
mass out of the canal.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> After the terminal
mass had thus been pushed out, the colon with
the remainder of its contents returned to nearly
its former position (Fig. 8, 3.46). About two
hours afterward this remnant had been spread
throughout the length of the large intestine by
means of the slowly moving rings. Figure 7 is a
radiograph of the same colon pictured in Figure
8; the radiograph was taken at 11.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and
at 12.15 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the material in the lower descending
colon was forced out in the manner above
described. Within three hours the remaining
portion had been spread into the evacuated region,
as shown in Figure 8, 3.11. The manner
in which the material is spread from the region
of the antiperistaltic waves into the region of
the slowly advancing rings presents a problem.
During normal living new food constantly arriving
in the colon must force the old contents
forward just as the later parts of a meal force
forward the earlier parts; there is no doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
however, that most of the contents of the
cæcum and the ascending colon may be passed
onward even during starvation. The emptying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
of these regions, according to my observations,
is never complete; for after considerable time
has elapsed and the large intestine is cleared
and dilated with gas, some substance is still
to be detected in the cæcum and clinging to
the walls of the ascending colon. The only
activities manifested here are the antiperistaltic
waves and the strong tonic contraction of the
whole circular musculature shown in Figure 6.
It is clear that the latter activity would serve to
press into the transverse colon a considerable
portion of the contents of the ascending colon,
and the remnant seen clinging to the walls would
be the part not thus pressed forward.</p>

</div>

<p>Twice I have seen appearances which might
account for the emptying of the first portion of
the large intestine in a more thorough manner
than that above described. At one time, without
apparent stimulation, strong tonic contraction
occurred along the entire length of the
ascending colon, which forced the contents almost
wholly into the transverse portion. This
action seemed merely an exaggerated form of
that observable after food passes the ileocæcal
valve (see Fig. 6). At another time, after a
mass of food had passed through the ileocæcal
valve, after the ascending colon had contracted
generally and the antiperistaltic waves had
coursed over it in the usual manner, a deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
constriction appeared at the valve and ran upward
without relaxation nearly the length of the
ascending colon, pushing the contents before it.
For an instant the wave paused; then the constriction
relaxed and the food returned towards
the cæcum. These observations indicate that
either a general contraction of the wall of the
large intestine or a true peristalsis may be effective
in pressing waste matter from the region
where antiperistalsis is the usual activity into the
region where the slowly advancing rings may
carry it on to evacuation (see Fig. 7).</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Question of Antiperistalsis</span></h4>

<p>In 1894 Grützner published an observation
and made an assumption about which there has
since been much controversy. He maintained
that when normal salt solution, holding in suspension
hair, powdered charcoal, or starch
grains, is injected into the rectum, it is carried
upward into the small intestine and may even
enter the stomach. These experiments have
been repeated by several observers. Some
have confirmed Grützner’s results; others have
failed, after using most careful methods, to find
any evidence of the passage of the injected
material back to the stomach, and they have
declared that the apparent success was due to
carelessly allowing the food of the animal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
become contaminated with the test materials, so
that these were introduced into the stomach
by way of the mouth. That antiperistalsis does
not occur in the small intestine seems to be
proved by Mall’s experiment of reversing a
portion, sewing it in place, and then finding that
the food does not pass the reversed region, but
collects at the upper end. Sabbatani and Fasola
reversed stretches of small intestine of varying
length, and found that the reversed portions
allowed fluids to pass, but that the persistence
of the physiological direction of movement
caused an accumulation of undigested food in
the region of the upper suture. However a
portion of the intestine lay in relation to the
rest, it always manifested the normal peristalsis.
Many other observers working directly on
the intestine confirm this testimony and state
that the progress of the constriction-rings is
always downward, and that antiperistalsis is not
physiological. In 1898, however, Grützner took
his stand again in favour of a backward movement
in the intestines, and in a somewhat metaphysical
manner argued that peristalsis and
antiperistalsis belong to each other just as relaxation
of muscle is related to contraction. He
assumed that as the contents are advanced by
slow peristalsis, so are they returned by a similar
movement in the opposite direction, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
mentions several pathological cases (fistula of
intestine) to substantiate the assumption.</p>

<p>By means of the X-rays it is possible to see
just what takes place when a fluid is injected
into the rectum. For the purpose of determining
how nutrient enemata are received and acted
upon in the intestines, I have introduced thin,
fluid masses in large and small amounts, and
thick, mushy masses in large and small amounts,
in different animals. The enemata consisted of
100 c.c. of milk, one egg, ten to fifteen grams
of bismuth subnitrate, and two grams of starch
to hold the bismuth powder in suspension. To
make the thick enema all these were stirred
together and boiled to a soft mush; to make the
thin enema all the parts were boiled together
except the egg, which was added after the boiled
portion was cooled. The small amount injected
was 25 c.c.; the large amount almost 90 c.c.,
about the capacity of the large intestine when
removed from the body. The animals were
given first a cleansing injection, and after this
was effective the nutrient material was introduced.
In order to make sure of the observation,
a control radiograph was first taken to
show no bismuth food present, and other radiographs
taken at varying intervals after the injection
to record the course the food was following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus-420" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img src="images/illus-420.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 9.</span>—- Radiographs showing that after a large nutrient enema (about 90 c.c.) has been given the food
is forced more and more from the large into the small intestine. The enema was introduced at about
1.40 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> At 3.00 segmentation was occurring in many loops.
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>

<p>These experiments show that when small
amounts of nutrient fluid are introduced they
lie first in the descending colon. In every instance
antiperistaltic waves are set going by the
injection, and the material is thereby carried to
the cæcum. When large amounts are injected
they stop for a moment in the region between
the transverse and descending colon, as if a
constriction existed there. Then a considerable
amount of the fluid passes the point, and antiperistaltic
waves carry it to the cæcum. In any
case the repeated passing of the waves seems to
have the effect of promoting absorption, for in
the region where these waves continue running,
the shadows become gradually more dim, and
finally the bismuth appears to be only on the intestinal
walls; in other regions, <i>e. g.</i> in the descending
colon, the shadows retain their original
intensity. Small injections have never in my
experience been forced even in part into the
small intestine; but with the larger amounts,
whether fluid or mushy, the radiographs show
many coils of the small intestine containing the
bismuth food.</p>

<p>The passage of the injected material beyond
the ileocæcal valve is probably due entirely to
antiperistalsis in the colon,&mdash;a factor unknown
to both Grützner and his opponents. The valve,
which is thoroughly competent for food coming
normally from the small intestine into the large,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
is curiously incompetent for a substance, even
of the consistency of thick cream, introduced
in large amount by rectum. When the valve
first permits the food to enter the ileum, the
fluid pours through and appears suddenly as
a winding mass occupying several loops of the
intestine (Fig. 9, 1.50, about ten minutes after
the injection). The mass is continuous from
the valve to the other end; antiperistalsis is
therefore not visible in the small intestine under
the circumstances of this experiment. The
antiperistaltic waves of the colon, however, continue
running; the transverse and ascending
colon are thus almost emptied, and the small intestine
more and more filled with food (Fig. 9,
2.15 and 3.00). After a short time the typical
segmenting movements can be seen in the loops,
busily separating the food into small masses,
and over and over again dividing and redividing
them.</p>

<p>I have never seen food material pass back
from the colon so far as the stomach; but once,
about ten minutes after an injection of 100 c.c.
of warm water, the cat retched and vomited a
clear fluid resembling mixed water and mucus.
In the fluid were two intestinal worms still alive.</p>

<p>The importance of the mechanism by which
nutrient enemata are passed backward in the
intestine is evident. In the colon the nutrient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
material is worked over by the antiperistaltic
waves, intimately mixed with whatever digestive
juices may be present, and exposed to the
organs of absorption in that region. If the enemata
are large, the digestive and absorptive
processes are by no means confined to the
colon, but may take place along extensive surfaces
of the small intestine. I have repeatedly
seen rhythmic segmentation active throughout
many loops of the small intestine, thus exposing
the injected food to the same mixing and absorbing
processes as affect the nutriment which
has come through the stomach in a normal
manner.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Effect of Emotions and Sleep</span></h4>

<p>Observations on the stomach of the cat
showed that the peristalsis is inhibited whenever
the animal manifests signs of anxiety, rage,
or distress. Since the extrinsic innervation of a
large part of the intestinal tract is the same as
that of the stomach, it is of interest to note the
effect of emotional states on the movements of
the intestines. Esselmont, in a study of the
dog’s intestine, noted constantly after signs of
emotion a marked increase of activity lasting for
only a few moments. Fubini also observed that
fear occasioned more rapid peristalsis. There
is no doubt that many emotional states are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
strong stimulus to peristalsis, but it is equally
true that other emotional states inhibit peristalsis.
In the cat the same conditions which stop the
movements of the stomach stop also the movements
of the intestines.</p>

<p>The female cats used in these observations
ordinarily lie quietly on the holder and make
no demonstration. Sometimes, however, with
only a little premonitory
restlessness, the cat suddenly
flies into a rage,
lashing her tail from side
to side, pulling and jerking
with every limb, and
biting at everything near
her head. During such
excitement, and for some
moments after the animal
becomes pacified again,
the movements, both of the large and small intestine,
entirely cease. Such violence of excitement
is not necessary to cause the movements
to stop; a cat which was restless and continually
whining while confined to the holder
showed no signs of intestinal movements during
any period of observation (one period
lasted more than an hour), although the changes
in the distribution of the food observable from
one period to the next proved that movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
were going on during the quiet intermissions.
In another cat, uneasy and fretful for fifty minutes,
no activity was seen; then she became quiet
for several minutes, and peristalsis of the small
intestine appeared.</p>

<p>When the segmentation process in the small
intestine is stopped by excitement the segments
unite and the series of parts returns to the form
of a solid string. The change occurring in the
large intestine when the antiperistalsis is inhibited
by excitement is shown in Figure 10. The tonic
constrictions in the descending colon are apparently
not affected by emotional states, for they
do not seem to relax in the excitement which
causes the movements to cease.</p>

<p>By holding the mouth and nostrils closed, or
by pressing between the rami of the jaw, the
breathing may be stopped. As soon as the cat
shows distress from lack of breath every form
of intestinal movement stops.</p>

<p>The statement is sometimes made in text-books
of physiology that the gastric and intestinal
mechanisms cease to act during sleep. It is
worthy of note that nearly all the animals curled
up and slept during the time between observations;
nevertheless, the progress of the food
through the intestines continued. The statement
is also made that at night, even without
sleep, the intestines are almost entirely at rest;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
that this is their normal time for repose. I have
seen both large and small intestines actively at
work, however, from half past nine until half
past ten o’clock at night.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>1. Bismuth subnitrate, 10 to 33 per cent,
mixed with the food renders the movement of
the intestinal contents, and thereby the movements
of the intestinal walls, visible on the
fluorescent screen.</p>

<p>2. The activity most commonly seen in the
small intestine is the simultaneous division of
the food in a coil into small segments, and a
rhythmic repetition of the segmentation each
time applied to the new segments formed from
parts of those just divided. In the cat this
rhythmic segmentation may proceed at the rate
of thirty divisions per minute. The effects of the
constrictions causing the segmentation are the
mixing of the food and the digestive juices,
the bringing of the digested food into contact
with the absorbing mechanisms, and the emptying
of the venous and lymphatic radicles of their
contents by compression of the intestinal wall.</p>

<p>3. Peristalsis is usually combined with segmentation.
As the food is advancing, interfering
constrictions often separate the rear end of the
mass from the main body. The separation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
momentary, however; the rear end is swept into
union with the main body again, and the whole
mass is pushed onward until another constriction
repeats the changes.</p>

<p>4. The ileocæcal valve is thoroughly competent
for food entering the colon from the
ileum.</p>

<p>5. The usual movement of the transverse
and ascending colon and the cæcum is an
antiperistalsis. This recurs in periods about
every fifteen minutes, and each period lasts commonly
about five minutes; the waves recur during
a period at the rate usually of eleven waves
in two minutes. This antiperistalsis gives new
significance to the ileocæcal valve; for the food,
now in a closed sac, is thoroughly churned and
mixed by the constrictions running towards the
cæcum, and again exposed to absorbing walls
without any interference with the processes in
the small intestine.</p>

<p>6. As soon as new food enters the large
intestine a strong general contraction takes place
along the cæcum and ascending colon, forcing
some of the food onward; a moment later
antiperistaltic waves begin to pass.</p>

<p>7. With the accumulation of material in the
transverse colon, deep tonic constrictions appear
one after another and carry the material
into the descending colon, leaving the trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>verse
and ascending portions free for the antiperistaltic
waves.</p>

<p>8. In emptying the large intestine the
material in the lower descending colon is first
carried out by combined peristalsis and pressure
of abdominal muscles; the remainder of the
material is then spread into the evacuated region,
and this region is again cleared; the second remainder
may be similarly affected. In normal
life the new food arriving in the colon must
force forward the old contents of the ascending
and transverse colon.</p>

<p>9. The observations have revealed no evidence
of antiperistalsis in the small intestine,
but since the ileocæcal valve will allow nutrient
material under pressure to pass backward, the
antiperistalsis of the large intestine may force
into the small intestine a considerable portion
of a large nutrient enema. Segmentation in
the small intestine affects such an enema precisely
as it affects food which has passed normally
through the stomach.</p>

<p>10. Signs of emotion, such as fear, distress,
or rage, are accompanied by a total cessation of
the movements of both large and small intestines.
The movements continue in the cat both
during sleep and at night.</p>

<small>THE MAMMOTH SANITARIUM AND THE
LARGE ADOPTED FAMILY
OF DR. AND MRS. J. H. KELLOGG</small></h3>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[A report of one experiment has been selected from
<i>Modern Medicine</i> relative to the work of the laboratories connected
with the Battle Creek Sanitarium because it relates to
the effect of cooking and mastication upon food in illustration
of the statement of Dr. Campbell pertaining to these aids to
digestion. Much more evidence could be had from the Sanitarium
reports, but sufficient has already been given herewith
from various authoritative sources to justify our claims of the
great importance of mouth-treatment in human nutrition.</p>

<p>It may be said here, however, that the trial of thorough
mouth-work as an aid to digestion, which has been in progress
at the Sanitarium for more than a year, and which has finally
been accepted and prescribed as the first requirement of the
treatment of patients, is of the utmost significance. This is,
by far, the largest sanitarium in the world, having some hundreds
of physicians, nurses, and other attachés, and treating
many thousands of patients annually. The “cure” is based
upon natural methods of recuperation, and while all of the
staff, both medical and surgical, are fully equipped diplomatists,
and whereas the organisation has a legally and professionally
accepted medical school of its own, so-called medicines
are rarely used, and never except as antidotes to specific
poisons. Nature is assisted by scientific means to do the
curing, and now that an economic nutrition to relieve the
exhausted system of the patient from all possible strain
through ample mouth-treatment of food, as intended by the
anatomical, dental, and chemical plan on which man is constructed,
has been tried and accepted as a fundamental principle
of the institution, it gives a practical indorsement of the
claims set forth in “Glutton or Epicure,” and in this present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
book, and declares that they are of greatest importance in
securing health and efficiency.</p>

<p>The Battle Creek Sanitarium is a philanthropic and
humanitarian institution operating under a perpetual charter
which compels the use of all the profits gained to foster the
spread of the humanitarian work. More than sixty branches
of the parent institution have been established in or near large
cities in different parts of the world, under the title of The
American Medical Missionary Association, and each of these
branches conducts a life-saving business on Good Samaritan
principles. The organisation started its medical missionary
work some thirty-seven years ago, with almost no capital and
only one patient, in a small two-storey frame house, in the
then small village of Battle Creek, Michigan. The incorporators
were religious enthusiasts who believed that Christianity
should be expressed in works as much as in faith, in
curing the sick and healing the wounded, and thus preparing
the unfortunate for the reception of moral and spiritual
inspiration.</p>

<p>The best evidence that this scheme of procedure to attain
the ultimate end was a good one is shown by the success
of the institution in its growth from such small beginning to
the immense proportions of the present time, with one of its
buildings nearly a thousand feet in length and five storeys
in height and numerous other buildings radiating from the
main one and scattered about it in a finely wooded park.
Fire came and destroyed the old building and all its contents,
but yet it was soon rebuilt, and the concern goes on growing
and growing, because the foundation principle of the institution
is the beautiful Golden Rule, and the method of treatment
employed is taken from the open book of Nature.</p>

<p>While the organisation was primarily based upon a special
religious creedal enthusiasm, it has become so broadly altruistic
as to suggest a return to original Christianity as defined
in the Sermon on the Mount. In such Christian expression
honest agnostics, born Buddhists, and the tolerant of all the
different Christian creeds may join and say amen!</p>

<p>One of the splendid results of an economic nutrition,
attained by following the natural requirements and impulses,
is the curing of many diseases, among them several forms of
constipation. The writer has a genuine admiration for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
spirit that is the motive power of the Battle Creek Sanitarium
and firm belief in the Christianity demonstrated in the work,
especially in the private experiment of Dr. and Mrs. Kellogg,
with their family of adopted waifs. Twenty-four children of
unfortunate parents, waifs so unfortunate in their attractability
as to be hopelessly neglected, have been gathered under this
sheltering roof and are showing their mettle and gratitude by
splendid behaviour and brilliant accomplishment in a manner
that any proud parent might approve. To miss any opportunity
to express gratitude to Dr. and Mrs. Kellogg for giving
us such a splendid example of the true meaning of practical
Christianity would be showing symptoms of the worst form of
constipation; viz., constipation of appreciation and affection.—<span class="smcap">Horace

<p>Several points of interest are to be noted
in the above table, the first and most conspicuous
of which is the fact that the saliva did not
act at all upon the raw flour and raw wheat, as
shown by the total absence of maltose in the
cases represented in columns 3 and 4. The
small amount of dextrine and soluble starch
shown was, perhaps, already present in the raw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
grain, but this point I have not investigated. It
is clear, however, that no sugar was produced
when raw starch was taken, whereas the amount
of sugar produced after the ordinary test meal
was more than 1 gram in each 100 c.c. of stomach
fluid; in other words, the stomach fluid
contained more than one per cent of sugar without
taking into account the amount which had
been absorbed.</p>

<p>The figures for maltose in column 2 represent
a test meal in which little or no saliva was
mixed with the test meal, the food being swallowed
without chewing, indicating very slight
action of the saliva, the amount of maltose
found in the stomach fluid being but a trifle
more than one-fourth the amount obtained after
an ordinary test meal. The amount of soluble
starch and dextrine was less than half the normal
amount in the case of the raw flour, and
but little more in the case of the raw wheat.</p>

<p>Another point of interest is the increased
amount of lactic acid found in the test meal
taken without chewing, represented in column 2.
The coefficient of fermentation which represents
the number of milligrams of lactic acid (as expressed
in terms of HCl) found in 100 c.c. of
stomach fluid was more than double that found
after the same kind of test breakfast properly masticated,
represented in column 1. The results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
of this experiment distinctly associate acid fermentation
with imperfect mastication and imperfect
salivary digestion.</p>

<p>Another fact noted in a comparative study
of the results of the analysis of over 5000 stomach
fluids, which very strongly confirms this
idea, is that starch conversion is usually complete
in cases of apepsia, while lactic acid is
conspicuous by its absence. In nearly all cases
of apepsia which I have encountered, numbering
about forty cases in all, the most delicate
tests for lactic acid have failed to show its presence
except in the most minute quantities; in
most cases it was entirely absent.</p>

<p>There are a number of other points of interest
in the above table in addition to those
which relate particularly to starch digestion.
One of the most noteworthy of these is the fact
that the digestion of albumen was not unfavourably
influenced by the neglect to masticate the
food, the coefficient of digestion, in fact, being
raised from .82 to .97. This coefficient is a
qualitative and not a quantitative index. The
higher coefficient indicates a more perfect elaboration
of proteids and a close approach to an
absolutely perfect proteid digestion.</p>

<p>Another fact of perhaps even greater interest
has relation to the digestion of albumen
when the wheat was eaten raw, in the form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
either flour or wheat. The coefficient of proteid
digestion in both cases, as shown in columns
3 and 4, was 1.00, indicating perfect elaboration
of the albuminoids. From this it appears that
raw gluten, or the proteids of wheat, is digested
more perfectly when taken in a raw state than
when cooked, the very opposite of which we
have seen to be true of starch. The digestion
of raw starch may take place in the intestines,
by the action of the pancreatic juice, but cannot
take place in the stomach, for the reason
that the saliva has not the power to penetrate
the cellulose envelope of the starch granule,
and hence cannot digest raw starch.</p>

<p>This fact coincides in a most interesting
manner with the biological fact that man is
by nature a frugivorous animal. In the process
of ripening, the starch of fruits undergoes
a hydration similar to that which takes place in
cooking and in pancreatic digestion, whereby
the insoluble starch is converted into soluble
starch, dextrine, and sugar. This explains, also,
why well-ripened fruit may be eaten raw with
impunity, while unripe fruit and farinaceous
food of all sorts require cooking. In his diet,
man, like his nearest relative, the monkey, being
naturally a frugivorous animal, may eat fruits
in the state in which Nature has provided them;
but when he introduces other natural products<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
into his bill of fare, he must adopt artificial
means for securing the preparation for digestion
which Nature makes in the ripening process
of fruits.</p>

<p>The coefficient of chlorine liberation (<i>m</i>) is
very nearly uniform, indicating that the mastication
of food and the cooking of food have little
influence upon this digestive function.</p>

<p>The coefficient of salivary activity (<i>c</i>) was
determined independently for each test breakfast.
Its practical uniformity indicates that there
was no essential change in the character or quality
of the saliva to account for the differences
shown by the totals in relation to the stomach
digestion of starch.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The “No Breakfast Plan,” evolved from the long experimental
experience of Dr. Dewey, to secure much needed rest
for the stomach and intestines, is described in a book bearing
that title which can be had direct from the author by addressing
him at his home, Meadville, Penn., U. S. A.</p>

<p>“No Breakfast” is, evidently, a misnomer, but means, in
the present application, an appetite <i>earned</i> after arising from
sleep. The writer, for instance, often begins work so early in
the morning that by the time the ordinary breakfast is ready
he has already done a fair day’s work.</p>

<p>The writer has no reported details of the work of Dr.
Dewey to add to this volume. In “Glutton or Epicure”
full appreciation of this Esculapian Luther is expressed and
extracts of his writings are reprinted. In fighting for more
than forty years for the principle of less abuse of the tired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
body of man, Dr. Dewey has rendered a service that some
time will be reckoned very great; and while there is no
scientific report of the good doctor’s work to call for introductory
comment, it would be equally unhealthy to miss an
opportunity to express gratitude for what he has done for us
all.</p>

been doing most valuable service in testing the usefulness of
fruits and nuts as human foods. He generously furnished the

years of observation, showing low nitrogen possibilities similar
to those demonstrated by the writer and his colleagues at
Cambridge and Yale. These have since been published, and

<small>THE ESSENTIALS AND SEQUENCE IN LIFE</small></h3>
</div>

<p>It would seem a considerable departure
from the study of menticulture as advised
in the author’s book, “Menticulture,” to
jump at once to an investigation of the
physiology and psychology of nutrition of
the body and then over to the department
of infant and child care and education as
pursued in the <i>crêche</i> and in the kindergarden;
but as a matter of fact, if study
of the causation of human disabilities and
misfortunes is attempted at all, the quest
leads naturally into all the departments of
human interest, and first into these primary
departments.</p>

<p>The object of this statement is to
link up the different publications of the
writer into a chain of consistent suggestions
intended to make life a more simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
and agreeable problem than many of us
too indifferent or otherwise inefficient and
bad fellow-citizens make of it.</p>

<p>It is not an altogether unselfish effort
on the part of the author of the A. B. C.
Life Series to publish his findings. In the
consideration of his own mental and physical
happiness it is impossible to leave out
environment, and all the units of humanity
who inhabit the world are part of his and
of each other’s environment.</p>

<p>It would be rank presumption for any
person, even though gifted with the means
to circulate his suggestions as widely as
possible, and armed with the power to
compel the reading of his publications,
to think that any suggestions of his could
influence any considerable number of his
fellow-citizens of the world, or even of his
own immediate neighbourhood, to accept
or follow his advice relative to the management
of their lives and of their communal
and national affairs; but while the
general and complete good of humanity
should be aimed at in all publications,
one’s immediate neighbours and friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
come first, and the wave of influence
spreads according to the effectiveness of
the ideas suggested in doing good; that
is, in altering the point of view and conduct
of people so as to make them a better
sympathetic environment.</p>

<p>For instance, the children of your
neighbours are likely to be the playmates
of your own children, and the children of
degenerate parents in the slum district
of your city will possibly be the fellow-citizen
partners of your own family. Again,
when it is known that right or wrong nutrition
of the body is the most important
agent in forming character, in establishing
predisposition to temperance or intemperance
of living, including the desire for
intoxicating stimulants, it is revealed to
one that right nutrition of the community
as a whole is an important factor in his
own environment, as is self-care in the
case of his own nourishment.</p>

<p>The moment a student of every-day
philosophy starts the study of problems
from the A. B. C. beginning of things,
and to shape his study according to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
A. B. C. sequence, each cause of inharmony
is at once traced back to its first expression
in himself and then to causes
influenced by his environments.</p>

<p>If we find that the largest influences
for good or bad originate with the right
or wrong instruction of children during
the home training or kindergarden period
of their development, and that a dollar
expended for education at that time is
worth more for good than whole bancs
of courts and whole armies of police to
correct the effect of bad training and bad
character later in life, it is quite logical
to help promote the spread of the kindergarden
or the kindergarden idea to include
all of the children born into the world,
and to furnish mothers and kindergarden
teachers with knowledge relative to the
right nutrition of their wards which they
can themselves understand and can teach
effectively to children.</p>

<p>If we also find that the influence of the
kindergarden upon the parents of the infants
is more potent than any other which
can be brought to bear upon them, we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
clearly that the way to secure the widest
reform in the most thorough manner is
to concentrate attention upon the kindergarden
phase of education, advocate its
extension to include even the last one of
the children, beginning with the most
needy first, and extending the care outward
from the centre of worst neglect to
finally reach the whole.</p>

<p>Experience in child saving so-called,
and in child education on the kindergarden
principle, has taught the cheapest
and the most profitable way to insure
an environment of good neighbours and
profit-earning citizens; and investigation
into the problem of human alimentation
shows that a knowledge of the elements of
an economic nutrition is the first essential
of a family or school training; and also
that this is most impressive when taught
during the first ten years of life.</p>

<p>One cannot completely succeed in the
study of menticulture from its A. B. C.
beginning and in A. B. C. sequence without
appreciation of the interrelation of
the physical and the mental, the personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
and the social, in attaining a complete
mastery of the subject.</p>

<p>The author of the A. B. C. Life
Series has pursued his study of the
philosophy of life in experiences which
have covered a great variety of occupations
in many different parts of the world
and among peoples of many different
nations and races. His first book, “Menticulture,”
dealt with purging the mind
and habits of sundry weaknesses and deterrents
which have possession of people
in general in some degree. He recognised
the depressing effect of anger and
worry and other phases of <i>fearthought</i>.
In the book “Happiness,” which followed
next in order, <i>fearthought</i> was shown to be
the unprofitable element of forethought.
The influence of environment on each
individual was revealed as an important
factor of happiness, or the reverse, by
means of an accidental encounter with a
neglected waif in the busy streets of
Chicago during a period of intense
national excitement incident to the war
with Spain, and this led to the publication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
of “That Last Waif; or, Social Quarantine.”
During the time that this last
book was being written, attention to the
importance of right nutrition was invited
by personal disabilities, and the experiments
described in “Glutton or Epicure;
or, Economic Nutrition” were begun and
have continued until now.</p>

<p>In the study of the latter, but most
important factor in profitable living, circumstances
have greatly favoured the
author, as related in his latest book,
“The A. B.-Z. of Our Own Nutrition.”</p>

<p>The almost phenomenal circulation of
“Menticulture” for a book of its kind,
and a somewhat smaller interest in the
books on nutrition and the appeal for
better care of the waifs of society, showed
that most persons wished, like the author,
to find a short cut to happiness by
means of indifference to environment,
both internal and external, while habitually
sinning against the physiological
dietetic requirements of Nature. In smothering
worry and guarding against anger the
psychic assistance of digestion was stimu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>lated
and some better results were thereby
obtained, but not the best attainable
results.</p>

<p>Living is easy and life may be made
constantly happy by beginning right; and
the right beginning is none other than
the careful feeding of the body. This
done there is an enormous reserve of
energy, a naturally optimistic train of
thought, a charitable attitude towards
everybody, and a loving appreciation of
everything that God has made. Morbidity
of temperament will disappear from an
organism that is economically and rightly
nourished, and death will cease to have
any terrors for such; and as <i>fear</i> of death
is the worst depressant known, many of
the <i>worries</i> of existence take their everlasting
flight from the atmosphere of the
rightly nourished.</p>

<p>The wide interest now prevalent in
the subjects treated in The A. B. C. Life
Series is evidenced by the scientific, military,
and lay activity in connection with
the experiments at the Sheffield Scientific
School of Yale University and elsewhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
as related in the “A. B.-Z. of Our Own
Nutrition” and in “The New Glutton or
Epicure” of the series.</p>

<p>The general application is more fully
shown, however, by the indorsement of
the great Battle Creek Sanitarium, which
practically studies all phases of the subject,
from health conservation and child
saving to general missionary work in
social reform.</p>

afforded by the lusty use of the voice. It a natural for the
young human to cry and to shout, and unless this instinct is
allowed full play the child is apt to suffer in health. I cannot
but think that the modern child is too much repressed in this
respect, and that he is not afforded, especially in towns, proper
opportunity of venting his vocal energy in out-door play. May
we not have here a contributory factor in the causation of

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> Among the Australian skulls I have examined in museums
caries of the wisdom teeth&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in those very teeth
which, as shown by their atrophy, are least used&mdash;is by no
means uncommon (though it is possible that some of the skulls
belong to natives who have embraced the dietetic customs of
the white man). I submit that this fact may fairly be used as
an argument in favour of the view that inefficient use of the
teeth predisposes them to caries by interfering with their
resisting power, though it must be acknowledged that the position
of the wisdom teeth places them at a disadvantage, owing
to the tendency of food to accumulate about them, especially
in undeveloped jaws in which they have not adequate room.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
